# Adobe Experience Cloud Auditor{#adobe-experience-cloud-auditor}

Adobe Experience Cloud Auditor is a service of the Adobe Experience Cloud that was co-developed with ObservePoint, experts in validating digital implementations.

>Access to Auditor is being granted in a rolling fashion. All customers will have access by the end of April, 2018.

With Auditor, Adobe Experience Cloud users receive a report that grades their Adobe implementation and gives pointers on how to improve it. Auditor helps you get more value from your Adobe products, individually and collectively.

With Auditor, you can:

* **Scan** Scan 500 web pages at a time for Adobe technology. Use advanced filters to include or exclude any pages as needed. You may run one audit at a time and an unlimited number of audits. 

* **Understand** Receive a report that scores your Adobe implementations based on tag presence, configuration, and consistency. 

* **Improve** Get recommendations on how to upgrade your implementation to align with best practices so you get the full value of your Adobe investment. Auditor goes beyond broad-stroke recommendations and tells you exactly what's wrong with a specific implementation, the webpage where the issue was found, and then gives guidance on how to fix it.

For your website to effectively drive more business and deliver great experiences, it needs to be implemented properly. If not, the software will either deliver a fraction of its potential value, or nothing at all.

But, maintaining intricate implementations on websites in a constant state of flux is a heavy burden. Auditor transforms this burden into an opportunity that increases the return on your Adobe investment.

By empowering you to troubleshoot and correct your own implementations, Auditor gives you greater control over your implementation tags and, therefore, your data. This reduces the need to contact Customer Care with questions about your implementation tags.

Auditor has been developed as a cooperative effort between Adobe and ObservePoint. Auditor users may use limited ObservePoint functionality for no additional cost. To use Auditor, you must opt-in to communications from ObservePoint.
