   >A smart campaign with triggers runs in Trigger mode. It runs on one person at a time based on events triggered and any additional filters.

1. Click the drop-down and choose an operator (e.g. **is**, **is not**, etc.) for the trigger you chose.

   >Red lines indicate errors or missing information. If not
   corrected, the campaign will be invalid and won't run.

   >[!TIP]

   >In a smart campaign with both triggers and filters, the
   triggers go at the top and when triggered, only people who satisfy the filter criteria go through the flow.

1. Define the trigger.
