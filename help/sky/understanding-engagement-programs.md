## Cast

A cast is the event of sending emails from an Engagement Program.

>Engagement Programs are not designed to be used with operational emails.

## Stream Cadence

You decide when a cast happens by setting up stream cadence. This is how you schedule content to go out at regular intervals.

## Person Cadence

A person cadence is a status that defines its ability to receive content from an engagement program. You can use the Change Engagement Program Cadence flow step to change this to Paused or Normal.

## Exhausted

Once a person has received every piece of content in a stream, we call the person exhausted.

## Content Engagement Level

Content Engagement Level is a 0 to 100 point score that Marketo will give your content. This number is determined by a sophisticated formula using opens, clicks, unsubscribes, program success, and other factors.
