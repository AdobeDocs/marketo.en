## On-Demand Loading

An empty folder icon indicates that the folder contains assets that haven't been modified within the [selected date range](/help/sky/configuring-the-tree.md) and are thus hidden. To view these assets, hover over the folder icon, which will change to the refresh icon shown below. Click to refresh and load all assets.
