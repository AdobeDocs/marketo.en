# Remove Stream Content

You can either remove or archive a piece of content. Unlike removing stream content, [archiving](help/sky/archive-and-unarchive-stream-content.md) preserves all the history associated to the content. If you don't mind losing the historical stats of some content and just want to remove it, here's how to do it.

1. Select your engagement program.
