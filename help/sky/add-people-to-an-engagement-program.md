# Add People to an Engagement Program

There are several ways that people can become members of an engagement program:

* [Add to Engagement Program](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Add+to+Engagement+Program)
* [Change Engagement Program Cadence](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Change+Engagement+Program+Cadence) flow step
* [Change Engagement Program Stream](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Change+Engagement+Program+Stream) flow step
* [Change Program Status](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Change+Program+Status) flow step
* If a person fills out a form local to an engagement program
* Importing members into an engagement program (via [!UICONTROL Members] tab within program)
* If you are using Salesforce as your CRM and have a Salesforce campaign tied to your engagement program, adding someone to the Salesforce campaign on the CRM side will also make them a member of the engagement program.
