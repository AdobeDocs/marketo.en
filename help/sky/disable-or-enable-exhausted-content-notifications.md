# Disable or Enable Exhausted Content Notifications

<br>&nbsp;

When people exhaust all content in a stream, [!DNL Marketo] can send you a notification. You can disable/enable the notifications based on your needs.

1. Select your engagement program.

If you enable notifications, you will see something on the stream itself as well as receive an email notification.
