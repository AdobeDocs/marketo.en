# Save Flow Actions

<br>&nbsp;

Flow steps tell Marketo what you want to have happen to a group of people that qualify (the people you chose in the smart list). Saving a specific flow will save time.

## Saving Flow Actions

1. In [!UICONTROL Marketing Activities], select your smart campaign (or create a new one).

And you're done. Next time you create a smart campaign, you'll have access to the same exact set of flow actions. Keep reading to see how to access them...

## Using Saved Flow Actions

1. In [!UICONTROL Marketing Activities], select your smart campaign (or create a new one).
