>* Assets no longer appear in auto-suggest.
>* Archived templates are not available when creating an email or landing page in [!UICONTROL Design Studio].
>* Archived pages can’t be used in landing page test groups.
>
>The following functionalities do **not** change when archiving:
>
>* Global search still finds results in archived folders.
>* An asset that’s in use will continue to work even after it’s archived.
>* You can use a filter to select archived assets for use in reports.
>* Archived assets are not deactivated. They must also be deactivated if you want them to stop run.
