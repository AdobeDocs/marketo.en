# Use Filters to Sort the Tree

Use filters to quickly sort items in the tree and view the most relevant content.

To access the filter panel, click the **Filters** icon at the top of the tree. Content automatically loads in the tree as you apply filters.

## Choose Date Range

You can use this feature to find assets that were created or modified within a specific date range; e.g., last week, in the past three months, etc.

By default, Marketo loads all content from the past six months. To change this, select a range from the **Choose Date Range** drop-down. These settings are sticky and will also be applied the next time you log into Marketo.

You can also further refine these filters by clicking the arrow next to a content type and choosing from the available options. For example, you can filter by campaign state for both batch and trigger campaigns.
