# Apply Communication Limits to a Smart Campaign

It's not a good idea to email someone multiple times a day, or too many times in a week. Luckily, Marketo has communication limits to help.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Remember to [enable communication limits](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Enable+Communication+Limits)

>[!NOTE]
>
>When any person exceeds the set communication limits, Marketo blocks non-operational emails (operational emails always send).

1. Select your smart campaign and click the [!UICONTROL **Schedule**] tab.

1. Open Qualification Rules and check the [!UICONTROL **Block non-operational emails**] checkbox.

>[!TIP]
>
>To make this the default, edit your [communication limits](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Enable+Communication+Limits) in the Admin section.

Now you can be assured you aren't accidentally sending too many emails to your audience.
