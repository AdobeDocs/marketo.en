   >You can set your cadence to run every day by picking **Repeats: Weekly** / **Every: 1 Week** / **On:** all days.

1. Now pick the Time. Check the box if you want to use [Recipient Time Zone](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Schedule+Engagement+Programs+with+Recipient+Time+Zone) (i.e., deliver according to local time zones), then click **Save**.

1. Hover over the info icon. You'll see what days future casts will go out.
