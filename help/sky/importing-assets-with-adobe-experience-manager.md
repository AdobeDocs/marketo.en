# Importing Assets with Adobe Experience Manager

<br>&nbsp;

The Asset Picker allows Marketo customers to access, select, and import AEM assets into Marketo's Design Studio. You must be an Admin to perform these steps.

>[!NOTE]
>Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is an independent product and must be purchased separately. Please contact your Customer Success Manager to learn more.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure you've already performed the [AEM Configuration](https://docs.marketo.com/x/FwPLAQ) in Marketo Classic.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >Currently, this feature is only fully supported in Firefox. It is not supported in Safari, and it might not work in the latest version of Chrome, depending on your SameSite cookie settings.

## Things to Note

* Marketo currently supports Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.4 and 6.5.
* All users in your instance will be able to view/access the images you import.
* Images are not automatically updated. If an image you imported into the Marketo Design Studio is updated in AEM, you must manually re-import it into Marketo.
