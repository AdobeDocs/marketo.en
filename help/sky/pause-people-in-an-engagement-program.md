# Pause People in an Engagement Program

<br>&nbsp;

When a person is a member of an engagement program, they will receive content until they've [exhausted all content](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/People+Who+Have+Exhausted+Content). You can use the [Change Engagement Program Cadence](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Change+Engagement+Program+Cadence) flow step to stop people from receiving content even if they've not yet exhausted content.

1. In your smart campaign, choose the person/people you want paused in the smart list. Then in the flow, find and drag over the [!UICONTROL **Change Engagement Program Cadence**] flow action.

You can set the person back to [!UICONTROL **Normal**] if you want them to begin receiving content again. They will resume where they left off.

>Pausing a person will prevent them from receiving content, but they will still transition between streams if they meet the criteria.
