   **Definition**

   * New window: Opens the link in a different window
   * Current window: Opens the link in the same window
   * Parent: If there are nested frames on the page, it will open the link one level up
   * Full body: Opens the link in the main window

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If Include mkt_tok is checked, Marketo displays a link
   preview of the branded tracking domain (e.g., http://
   mkto-sjqe3355.com/mn/...). If you clear this checkbox, the link is changed. If you turn off link tracking for emails or landing pages, >the URL will be shortened to its basic length (e.g., www.examplepage.com).

1. Optionally, under Advanced, you can customize your link using CSS. Click **Save**.
