# Edit Qualification Rules in a Smart Campaign

<br>&nbsp;

Qualification rules control how many times someone can run through the flow in a smart campaign. By default, even if someone triggers a smart campaign multiple times, they will only be sent through the flow once. Here's how to modify those settings.

1. Select the campaign and go to the [!UICONTROL **Schedule**] tab.

1. Choose how often to run your people through the smart campaign flow: [!UICONTROL **daily**], [!UICONTROL **weekly**], [!UICONTROL **monthly**], or [!UICONTROL **once every # days**].

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When you set a rule for once every day, [!DNL Marketo] converts that to hours. For example, if you set the rule for once per day, and a person qualifies at 10 p.m. on a Sunday night, it can't qualify again until 10 p.m. Monday night.
   >
   >This logic also applies when using weeks or months. A month is always counted as 30 days.

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Confirm**] when done.
