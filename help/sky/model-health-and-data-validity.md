# Model Health and Data Validity

<br>&nbsp;

The performance of your models depends on the quality and completeness of the input data. Here's how to assess your model health.

Navigate to the **Models and Data Health** section under **Predictive Audiences** in the **Admin** area of Marketo Classic. Here you will see all of your models and their statuses.

* **Training Status**: Indicates whether your model is actively training (improving predictions). Training automatically occurs every 2 weeks. Any models that are _Processing_ could take up to 24 hours to finish. For any _Failed_ models, please contact [Marketo Support](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/Support/ct-p/Support).
* **Scoring Status**: Indicates whether your model is actively calculating predictions (likelihood percentages) for program members.
* **Performance**: Categorization of your model health based on Data Completeness and Data Quality (see below).
* **Data Completeness**: Percentage of data attributes that are present/complete.
* **Data Quality**: Percentage of attributes that contain good, usable data.
