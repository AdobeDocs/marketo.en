# Getting Started with Predictive Audiences

<br>&nbsp;

Predictive Audiences (PA) utilizes AI and machine learning to enable you to target audiences more effectively and take proactive steps to reach your marketing goals.

PA includes the following features:

* [Goal Tracking and Projected Registrations](/help/sky/understanding-goal-tracking-and-projected-registrations.md)
* AI/ML-based Insights
* Registration and Attendance Likelihood values for every lead in an event program
* [Predictive Filters](/help/sky/predictive-filters.md)

The performance of the AI/ML models relies on the data in your subscription. The more frequently a model is used, the more tuned it will become to your specific subscription data and business.
