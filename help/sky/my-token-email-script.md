# My Token: Email Script

<br>&nbsp;

For advanced developers, you can use [Velocity scripts](https://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.7/user-guide.html) in your emails by setting up an Email Script token. Here's how to do it.

1. In the [!UICONTROL My Tokens] tab of your program or folder, drag an **[!UICONTROL Email Script]** token to the [!UICONTROL Local Tokens] canvas.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >If you're typing in tokens free-form, be sure to check/activate all corresponding tokens in the tree, or they will be treated as plain text and won't work.

1. Write your script in Velocity. Here are some useful resources to help you:
