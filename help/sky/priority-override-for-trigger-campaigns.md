# Priority Override for Trigger Campaigns

Admins can override Marketo's determined priority for trigger campaigns to set priorities that better align with business objectives.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is only available for trigger campaigns and to
>users who have been granted the “Edit Trigger Campaign
>Priority” permission.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>It is strongly advised that you use this feature on a limited
>set of business critical campaigns (25 is the recommended
>maximum). Using the feature loosely on a large set can
>adversely affect overall campaign execution.

>the campaign; people who are already in-queue will not be
>affected.
