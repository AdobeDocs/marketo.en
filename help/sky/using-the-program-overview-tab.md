# Using the Program Overview Tab

<br>&nbsp;

There are three sections under the Program Overview tab: [!UICONTROL **Details**], [!UICONTROL **Schedule**], and [!UICONTROL **Reports**]. Here's a quick look at each one.

## Details

The main details page displays general information about your program.

At the bottom of the page are two sections: [!UICONTROL **Program Stats**] and [!UICONTROL **Used By**]. [!UICONTROL **Program Stats**] shows you key metrics about program performance, and [!UICONTROL **Used By**] is an easy way to see where your program is being used in Marketo.

## Schedule

The program schedule view is a powerful feature that allows you to create, move, and edit entries directly from the calendar. You have the option to view the calendar by day, week, or month; you can also see all your entries for the month on the agenda page.
