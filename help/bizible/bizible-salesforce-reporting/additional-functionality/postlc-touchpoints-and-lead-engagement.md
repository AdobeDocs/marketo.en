PostLC Touchpoints and Lead Engagement - Bizible - Product Documentation

Bizible's Post-Lead Creation (PostLC) touchpoints are available for customers using multi-touch attribution models (W-Shape and above). When a Lead or Contact returns to your website and continues to fill out forms, these form submissions will register as PostLC touchpoints. These touchpoints allow you to see what content is driving Leads to continue to engage with your site, long after their first conversion. PostLC touchpoints share attribution credit with all the intermediary touchpoints within an Opportunity; 10% attribution credit is allotted to intermediary touchpoints, and is distributed equally among all touches.

You can adjust the number of PostLC touchpoints that will be displayed in SFDC. Typically we recommend pushing up to five PostLC touchpoints; each touchpoint takes up 1KB in SFDC.

PostLC touchpoints are dynamic. As a Lead or Contact continues to submit PostLC forms, Bizible will update the PostLC touchpoints in your CRM to show you their most recent form submissions. Specifically, if you've set a limit of 5 PostLC touchpoints, Bizible always push the 5 *most recent*touchpoints to your CRM.  In this example, this account has set their PostLC limit to four touchpoints. This Lead has already reached maximum number of PostLC touchpoints it can have in your CRM. The last PostLC touch was on 2/6/2018. If this person were to fill out another form the following day, Bizible will remove the first PostLC touchpoint from 11/9/2017 in order to add the latest touchpoint from 2/7/2018.

>Bizible will only update PostLC touchpoints on the Lead or Contact, and will not update PostLC attribution touchpoints on an Opportunity. All relevant PostLC touchpoints on a Contact will be included in the Opportunity.
