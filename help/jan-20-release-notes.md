>* **TLS 1.0 & 1.1 Deprecation**: In a continued effort to integrate with Adobe's release structure, we are shifting the deprecation of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 to January 13, 2020. More detailed information can be found [here](https://nation.marketo.com/docs/DOC-7059-tls-10-11-deprecation-faq).
> * **ITP 2.1+ Munchkin Update**: Due to changes to cookie policy for Safari, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome, Munchkin's ability to track users across sessions on the same domain will be limited by ITP to either 1 or 7 days based on the browser and browser version used by the visitor. To account for this, we are implementing a new web service to allow Munchkin cookies to be set with a Set-Cookie header via HTTP response. More information about how to implement this new service can be found [here](https://nation.marketo.com/docs/DOC-7351).
