>Check out the [Custom Field Types Glossary](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Custom+Field+Type+Glossary).

4. Enter the Name as you want it to appear in Marketo. The API Name is automatically generated. You can tweak it, but it cannot be renamed once set. Click Create when done.

You can now use this custom field in forms, flow steps and smart lists!
