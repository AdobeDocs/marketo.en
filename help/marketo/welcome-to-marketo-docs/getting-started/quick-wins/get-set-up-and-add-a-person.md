Get Set Up and Add a Person - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

There are a few things to do before you begin the missions.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

#### Step 1: Log In to Marketo {#getsetupandaddaperson-step1-logintomarketo}
