Create an Event in Marketo - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

A Marketo event tracks the progression of your people through a program. It pushes registration information and pulls attendance information using the ON24 adapter. The event captures the status of your people as they progress through it.

Here's how the data is exchanged:

When you create the Marketo event, select **Webinar** as the Channel type. You can edit this channel in Admin, as well as create a new channel. If you create a new channel, it must be of the type **Event with Webinar** for the integration to work. See [Create a Program Channel](../../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/administration/tags/create-a-program-channel.md) for more information.

Your next step is to [configure event settings and sync Marketo with your webinar](https://docs.marketo.com/x/IRCa).
