Disable Pre-fill for a Form Field - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

When a web visitor is known (cookied), Marketo forms will pre-fill fields with their information by default. If you want to turn this off, here's how to do it.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Form Pre-fill** is enabled by default. Landing page level pre-fill settings and admin level pre-fill settings trump the form level setting:
>
>Form < Landing Page < Admin

1. Go to **Marketing** **Activities**.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >Form Pre-fill does not work when embedding a form on your own pages. It only works on Marketo landing pages.

1. Select one of the fields and set **Form** **Pre**-**fill** to **Disabled**.

   >You can also disable form pre-fill at the landing page level or at the admin level.

1. Click **Finish**.
