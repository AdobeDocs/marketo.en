In order to most accurately sync your data back to Marketo, MSC requires that the person record has a Marketo ID saved to it. In order to sync the Marketo ID into MSC, you can click on the chevron next to an interesting Moment. When you see an Interesting Moment come through in the Live Feed, click on the drop-down arrow and the person record will be added to the MSC database with the Marketo ID.

Now you can use the engagement buttons from the Live Feed, Salesforce, Email Plugins, or Web Application to add leads to Marketing Campaigns. Create a call task to be reminded to follow-up with and leave notes to be used as call notes during the call.
