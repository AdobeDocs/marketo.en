Unexpected Error in Gmail - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

If you are receiving an "Unexpected Error" in Gmail when trying to send an email, you probably need to perform a reset on your Gmail connection.

##### 1. Go to Settings > Email Tracking > Manage. {#unexpectederroringmail-gotosettings>emailtracking>manage.}

##### 2. Click Disconnect from Gmail. {#unexpectederroringmail-clickdisconnectfromgmail.}

##### 3. After disconnecting, click Connect to Google. {#unexpectederroringmail-afterdisconnecting-clickconnecttogoogle.}

Once you are reconnected, go back to Gmail and refresh your page and try sending your email again. If it still doesn't work, please [submit a ticket](http://nation.marketo.com/community/support_solutions) to our Support Team.
