>Adding attachments is available if you're using Marketo Sales Connect. It is not available in Marketo's standard email editor.

To add attachments to your template, open the template editor and click&nbsp;**Attach Files**&nbsp;above the text editor. Then simply find and upload the&nbsp;attachment from your computer.

If you would like your attachments to be [tracked when they're opened](http://docs.marketo.com/display/TEST/How+to+Track+Your+Email+Attachments), click **Add**&nbsp;**Content**&nbsp;and select a .doc, PDF, or .ppt file.

After uploaded to a template, these files are stored in your Sales Connect Content. You&nbsp;can quickly add them to emails from your web browser or from the [web application](http://toutapp.com/login) by clicking **Add&nbsp;Content**&nbsp;in the&nbsp;template editor.
