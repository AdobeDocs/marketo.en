How to Set up Custom Domain Tracking - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

We give you the option to configure custom domain tracking for your links, so when someone hovers over a link, it will read “go.yourcompany.com” instead of “go.toutapp.com."

`To set this up, your IT administrator needs to follow the steps listed in our` [settings page](http://toutapp.com/custom_tracking_domain) `.`

Once you have this set up, we will whitelist any link you have in your email to appear as “go.yourcompany.com.”
