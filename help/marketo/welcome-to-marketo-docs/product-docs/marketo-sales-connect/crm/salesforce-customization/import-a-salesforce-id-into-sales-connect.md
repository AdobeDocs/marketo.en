Import a Salesforce ID into Sales Connect - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Sales Connect uses the Contact or Lead ID (also known as Salesforce ID), to help log information properly to Salesforce. There are a few ways that you can attach your Salesforce ID to your contacts in Sales Connect.

##### [Push to Sales Connect](http://docs.marketo.com/x/F4PS): Using Push to Sales Connect will create a contact in Sales Connect with all the key contact information, including the lead/contact's Salesforce ID. {#importasalesforceidintosalesconnect-pushtosalesconnect-usingpushtosalesconnectwillcreateacontactinsalesconnectwithallthekeycontactinformation-includingthelead/contact'ssalesforceid.}

##### [Send Marketo Sales Email, Add to Campaign, and Click to Call Buttons in SFDC](http://docs.marketo.com/x/DYPS): When you use any of these three buttons in Salesforce, we will push the contact to Sales Connect with the Salesforce ID. {#importasalesforceidintosalesconnect-sendmarketosalesemail-addtocampaign-andclicktocallbuttonsinsfdc-whenyouuseanyofthesethreebuttonsinsalesforce-wewillpushthecontacttosalesconnectwiththesalesforceid.}

##### [Import CSV](http://docs.marketo.com/x/HIPS): If you export a list of leads/contacts from Salesforce and you include a column with the Salesforce ID, you can map the field to Sales Connect on import. {#importasalesforceidintosalesconnect-importcsv-ifyouexportalistofleads/contactsfromsalesforceandyouincludeacolumnwiththesalesforceid-youcanmapthefieldtosalesconnectonimport.}
