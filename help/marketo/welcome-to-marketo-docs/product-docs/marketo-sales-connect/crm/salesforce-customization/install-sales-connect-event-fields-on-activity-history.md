Install Sales Connect Event Fields on Activity History - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Once you have installed the Enterprise package into Salesforce you can install Sales Connect event fields into your activity history section. Sales Connect event fields include information such as views, clicks, and campaigns. This allows you to have information about your emails directly imported into Salesforce.

Make sure you team up with your Salesforce Admin when performing these steps. In this example we will install the fields onto the **Leads Page Layout**. You can also install the fields onto the Contact, Account, and Opportunity Page Layouts. Remember, when logging emails to Accounts and Opportunities you will need the contact you are emailing associated as a contact role.
