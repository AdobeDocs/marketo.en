Enable/Disable Communication Limits in an Email Program - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

`When running an email program, you can choose to ignore or respect the` [admin level communication limit](../../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/administration/email-setup/enable-communication-limits.md) [s](../../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/administration/email-setup/enable-communication-limits.md) `. Here's how to do it.`

>Communication limits are [set in the Admin section](../../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/administration/email-setup/enable-communication-limits.md) and help you avoid sending one person too many emails.
