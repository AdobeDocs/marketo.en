Edit an Email's HTML - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

#### Breaking an Email From its Template {#editanemail'shtml-breakinganemailfromitstemplate}

These code changes **will not** break an email from its template:

* Editing the contents of any Module (including adding new Elements inside the Module)
* Adding a new Module to the Container
* Deleting a Module from the Container

* Changing mkto-specific attributes (for example, "mktoName" or "mktoImgUrl") of any Element outside of a Module
* Editing the contents of any Element (rich text, image, video, etc.) outside of a Module

These things you can do in the code editor **will **break the email from its template:

* Changing anything in the code outside of an Element or Module
* Adding or changing non-mkto attributes (for example, "id" or "style") of any Element outside of a Module
* Deleting an Element that is outside of a Module

>Search Code is also available in the [Email Template editor](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Create+a+New+Email+Template).

We recommend that you continue to edit your emails using Marketo's built-in functionality, but this code editor does provide flexibility if you need it.
