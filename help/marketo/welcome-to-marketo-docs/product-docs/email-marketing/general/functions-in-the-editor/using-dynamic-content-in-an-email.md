#### Apply Dynamic Content {#usingdynamiccontentinanemail-applydynamiccontent}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The number of dynamic content elements allowed is not unlimited. While there is no specific number limit (it can vary based on the combination of content), overusing dynamic content can negatively affect the email's performance. We recommend keeping the amount of dynamic content elements used to under 20 per email.

`1.`Click your segments and add your subject line.
