Create an Email - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

There are two main ways to create an email in Marketo. Let's look at both.

#### Create an Email in the Design Studio {#createanemail-createanemailinthedesignstudio}

##### 1. Go to the Design Studio. {#createanemail-gotothedesignstudio.}

Simple! Now for the other way...

And that's it!

Whichever method you choose brings you to the template picker.

##### 1. Give your email a name, click on the template you want to use, then click Create. {#createanemail-giveyouremailaname-clickonthetemplateyouwanttouse-thenclickcreate.}

>You can choose from a collection of ready-to-go responsive email templates, or a template you saved by first selecting **My Templates**, and following the same steps.

##### 2. Enter a subject line. There's a counter on the right to let you know if you're under the recommended 50 character max. {#createanemail-enterasubjectline.there'sacounterontherighttoletyouknowifyou'reundertherecommended50charactermax.}

Depending on the template you've chosen, you'll have different options in which to edit your email. For emails with modules, check out [Add Modules to your Email](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/email-marketing/general/email-editor-2.0/add-modules-to-your-email.md).

Your email is now created, so edit away!
