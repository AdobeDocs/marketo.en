>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

When a person has received every piece of content in a stream, it has exhausted all possibilities and will wait idle until more is added. You can find people that are "exhausted" in several ways.
