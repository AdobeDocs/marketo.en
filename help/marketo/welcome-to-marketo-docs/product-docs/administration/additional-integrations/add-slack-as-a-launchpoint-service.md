Add Slack as a LaunchPoint Service - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

There are two notification types included in the Slack integration:

* **System notifications**: Get Slack notifications regarding important events in your Marketo instance, like alerts about current campaign statuses and any issues that require immediate attention (CRM errors and API limits).
* **Interesting moments**: When a Marketo Insight has been triggered by a known individual from a sales account, lead owners can be notified via Slack. Notifications include lead information as well as details about the sales account.
