Enable Person Restrictions for Smart Campaigns - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

There is a feature in Marketo to limit the ***maximum ***number of people that can qualify for a smart campaign. This avoids accidentally emailing your whole database.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Admin Permissions Required**

>[!CAUTION]
>
>This applies only to batch campaigns and email programs.

1. Click **Admin **and then **Smart Campaign**.

   >
   >If the number of people that qualify to run through a smart campaign exceeds the limit set, then it will not run at all.

   Enter a limit and then click **Save**.
