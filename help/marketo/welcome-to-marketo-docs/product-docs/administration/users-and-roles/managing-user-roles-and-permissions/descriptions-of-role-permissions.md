Descriptions of Role Permissions - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

Below is a list of all available permissions that you can assign to your roles. Permissions are generally associated with specific functional areas inside Marketo and can help you control what areas and functionality different users have access to.

Some additional information about permissions:

* The â€œAccess" permission gives a role permission to view and sometimes edit that part of the application.
* For a role to have access to the sub-permissions ("Create", "Delete", etc.), that role must have "Access" permission to that part of the application. For example, if you want to give someone permission for Edit Campaigns, they must have overall permission to Access Marketing Activities.
* You may be able to see actions or assets that you do not have permission to use. However, if you try to access them, you'll see a message warning you about your limited access.
