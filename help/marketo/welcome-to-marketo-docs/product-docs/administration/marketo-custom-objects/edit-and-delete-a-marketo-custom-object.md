##### 5. Be sure to approve [the edited object](approve-a-custom-object.md). {#editanddeleteamarketocustomobject-besuretoapprovetheeditedobject.}

#### Delete a Custom Object {#editanddeleteamarketocustomobject-deleteacustomobject}

It's easy to delete a custom object, but you need to be careful. Custom objects may be connected to other objects or to smart lists. So, Marketo warns you before letting you click **Delete**.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>You can't restore a custom object after you delete it.

##### 1. Click Admin, and in Database Management, select Marketo Custom Objects. {#editanddeleteamarketocustomobject-clickadmin-andindatabasemanagement-selectmarketocustomobjects..1}

>You can also right-click the object and select **Delete Object**.

##### 4. If the custom object is in draft form, not approved yet, you'll get this warning. If you're sure, click Delete. {#editanddeleteamarketocustomobject-ifthecustomobjectisindraftform-notapprovedyet-you'llgetthiswarning.ifyou'resure-clickdelete.}

##### 5. If the custom object is already approved, there is greater risk if you delete it. So, you'll get this sterner warning. Enter I understand, check the Cannot Undo checkbox, and click Delete. {#editanddeleteamarketocustomobject-ifthecustomobjectisalreadyapproved-thereisgreaterriskifyoudeleteit.so-you'llgetthissternerwarning.enteriunderstand-checkthecannotundocheckbox-andclickdelete.}
