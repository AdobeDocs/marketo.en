Edit Subscription Settings - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

If you have access to multiple Marketo subscriptions and want to be sure which one you're using, try giving each one a unique name. That name then displays at the top of your subscription page.

For example, if you work in both production and sandbox instances, you can name one subscription **Marketo Production** and the other **Marketo Sandbox**.
