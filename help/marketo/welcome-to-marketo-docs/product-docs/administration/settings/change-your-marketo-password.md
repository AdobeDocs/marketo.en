Keep it secret! Keep it safe!

>[!TIP]
>
>What's a good password? Something long with lots of letters, numbers and symbols like " [[email protected]](http://docs.marketo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) !$ [[email protected]](http://docs.marketo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)". Except, not that one. Be creative and make your own.
