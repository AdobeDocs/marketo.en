Creating a Custom Tab for the Person Detail Page - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

>[!NOTE]

>**FYI**

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

If you find yourself looking for a specific set of fields in the person detail over and over again, consider creating a custom layout to make things easier.

1. Go to **Admin** and click **Field Management**.

   Awesome work! Now when you load a person's details, you can use your custom layout to access the information important to you.
