Choose which period you'd like to see metrics for. In this example we're looking at the current year (year-to-date).   ![](assets/3-1.png)

>We have temporarily removed the “Previous Year” selection. You still have the option of viewing the entire previous year’s performance data by using the Custom Range selection.

Metrics are presented via two charts: doughnut and bar.   ![](assets/four.png)

The doughnut chart shows the top ten channels for the metric you selected.

The bar chart displays program performance across all channels (ten programs at a time) for the metric you selected. To see more, click the arrow on the right to scroll to the next group.

Mouse over a bar to see additional details.   ![](assets/seven.png)
