Adding Custom Measures to a Revenue Explorer Report - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Sometimes, you want a custom measure in a report. It's easy to create your own.

In the example below, you are creating a calculated measure for soft bounces, which takes metrics already in the report and uses basic math to create a new metric. You can create other types of measures, too.

##### 1. Pull over the fields you need for your report. See [Adding Fields to a Revenue Explorer Report](adding-fields-to-a-revenue-explorer-report.md) for details. {#addingcustommeasurestoarevenueexplorerreport-pulloverthefieldsyouneedforyourreport.seefordetails.}
