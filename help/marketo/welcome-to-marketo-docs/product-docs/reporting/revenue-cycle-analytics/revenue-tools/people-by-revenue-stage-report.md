People by Revenue Stage Report - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

`You can create a report showing which stage of your` [Revenue Cycle Model](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics/revenue-cycle-models.md) `your people are in. The report includes any stage from the specified model as long as there is a person balance for the given date range of the report.`

These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).
