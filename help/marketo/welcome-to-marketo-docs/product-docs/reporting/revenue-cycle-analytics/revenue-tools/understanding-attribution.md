Understanding Attribution - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

#### What is attribution? {#understandingattribution-whatisattribution?}

Attribution is how Marketo gives credit to the [programs](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Programs)&nbsp;that help influence sales and opportunities.&nbsp;If you use the Marketo modeler, attribution can also give credit for moving someone forward in your business model.

#### Why keep track of this? {#understandingattribution-whykeeptrackofthis?}

Attribution helps you measure program success. Some programs are intended to generate new names, while others are intended to drive sales. By having a system of attribution, you can make educated decisions on what programs to invest in.

#### First-Touch (FT) Attribution {#understandingattribution-first-touch(ft)attribution}

First-Touch (FT) attribution answers a **simple business question,&nbsp;**"Which programs are good at acquiring profitable new names?"

#### Multi-Touch Attribution {#understandingattribution-multi-touchattribution}

Multi-Touch answers a **complicated business question,**&nbsp;"Which programs are most influential in moving people forward in the sales cycle over time?"&nbsp;

#### Rules of Attribution {#understandingattribution-rulesofattribution}

There are three rules of attribution:

1. Credit is split evenly
1. You can't give more credit than you earned
1. You can't give credit for something that happened in the past

In the following examples, you can apply these rules and understand everything you need about measuring program success.
