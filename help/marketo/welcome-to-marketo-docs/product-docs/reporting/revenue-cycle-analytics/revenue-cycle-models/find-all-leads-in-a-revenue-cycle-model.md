>[!TIP]
>
>You don't need both filters, just choose the one you need. We are just showing you both to be thorough. ![(smile)](assets/smile.svg)>

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If the stage of a lead is changed by an external campaign during the initial creation of the lead, then an activity is not logged in the database. This means that the lead wonâ€™t be included by the smart list filter.
