>[!NOTE]

>This example enabled a custom field group for a standard field (State). Therefore, only the Model Performance Analysis (Leads) Area was impacted. If a custom field group for a custom person or company field had been enabled, the enabled group would display in the Model Performance Analysis (Leads) section of the Sync Summary tab and the custom field count for Lead, Campaign, and Opportunity Analysis would increase by one.

##### 5. Click Save. {#enablecustomfieldgroupsformodelperformanceanalysis(leads)-clicksave.}
