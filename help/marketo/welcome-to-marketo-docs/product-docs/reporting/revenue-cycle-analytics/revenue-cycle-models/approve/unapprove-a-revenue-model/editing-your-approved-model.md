Editing Your Approved Model - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

#### Editing Your Model {#editingyourapprovedmodel-editingyourmodel}

##### 1. Select the model you want to make changes to in the Analytics section and click Edit Draft.  {#editingyourapprovedmodel-selectthemodelyouwanttomakechangestointheanalyticssectionandclickeditdraft.}

##### 2. You can't delete stages when editing a draft model (after the model's been approved). Instead, you can merge that stage with another in the model. Right-click the stage you want to merge and click Merge. {#editingyourapprovedmodel-youcan'tdeletestageswheneditingadraftmodel(afterthemodel'sbeenapproved).instead-youcanmergethatstagewithanotherinthemodel.right-clickthestageyouwanttomergeandclickmerge.}

##### 3. Choose the new stage for leads currently in the one selected, or select None to remove the leads from your model. When you're done, click Merge. {#editingyourapprovedmodel-choosethenewstageforleadscurrentlyintheoneselected-orselectnonetoremovetheleadsfromyourmodel.whenyou'redone-clickmerge.}

>[!TIP]
>
>If you make any changes to your stages, such as adding or merging them, make sure to change your Assignment Rules and Phases to reflect your edits.

#### Unapproving Your Model {#editingyourapprovedmodel-unapprovingyourmodel}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If you unapprove your model, all of its leads will be removed, and their history in the model will be deleted. Consider editing your model instead of unapproving it.

##### 1. Select the model you wish to unapprove. From the Model Actions menu, select Unapprove Model. {#editingyourapprovedmodel-selectthemodelyouwishtounapprove.fromthemodelactionsmenu-selectunapprovemodel.}

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you want to re-approve this model, you'll first need to reassign leads to the stages.

#### Creating More Models {#editingyourapprovedmodel-creatingmoremodels}

You can only have one approved model at a time. If you want to approve a model but already have one approved, you'll need to unapprove your current model first. If possible, try editing your model instead of creating a new one.
