1. In the **Analytics **area, click on the desired [saved report](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/creating-reports/save-a-report.md).

   >Alternatively, a saved report can be cloned to **Group Reports **by dragging the report into the folder.

1. Click **Report Actions **and select **Clone Report**.
