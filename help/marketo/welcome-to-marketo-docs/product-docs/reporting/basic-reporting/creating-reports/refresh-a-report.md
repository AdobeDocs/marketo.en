Refresh a Report - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

After viewing a report, Marketo stores it in your database so that it loads quickly upon your next viewing. Following your first view, reports automatically refresh every 24 hours so that they're always up-to-date. But you can refresh them manually any time you want.

##### 1. To see when your report was last updated, hover over the circle-arrow icon in the bottom left corner. {#refreshareport-toseewhenyourreportwaslastupdated-hoveroverthecircle-arrowiconinthebottomleftcorner.}
