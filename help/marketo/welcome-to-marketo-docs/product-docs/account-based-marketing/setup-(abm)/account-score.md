#### What is Account Scoring? {#accountscore-whatisaccountscoring?}

It's a systematic approach designed to help Sales and Marketing teams identify and prioritize the companies (including prospects) that are most likely to make a purchase.

In the complex world of B2B buying processes, itâ€™s rare that a single individual makes a purchase decision. There are often various roles involved, each with their own needs. Account-based scoring takes this into account by aggregating the lead scores from multiple leads and providing a score at an account level.

#### Common Examples {#accountscore-commonexamples}

| **Account Engagement Score** |Depth of engagement based on behavioral activities tracked across various channels (e.g. email, web, ad) from people in specific target accounts. |
|---|---|
| **Account Product Interest Score** |People from target accounts showing interest in the content from a specific product (e.g. downloading a white paper). |
| **Account Web Engagement Score** |People from target accounts visiting web channel. Same score can be created to measure channel engagement from email, ad, or other channels. |

#### How to Configure Account Score {#accountscore-howtoconfigureaccountscore}

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Explanation**
>
>To calculate account scores, you first need to create lead scores. Marketo ABM automatically aggregates lead scores to account scores. As an example, we'll take two of the above examples (*Account **Product Interest Score *and* Account Web Engagement Score*).
>
>First, create lead score fields that capture relevant details from each lead of a target account.  
>Then assign those lead scores to their respective account scores:  
>Account Product Interest Score = SUM (Lead Product Interest Score)  
>Account Web Engagement Score = SUM (Lead Web Engagement Score)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Users can create multiple account engagement scores and assign different person scores to different account scores.
