##### Step One: * [Issue a License](welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/account-based-marketing/setup-(abm)/issue-a-license.md)* - Decide who on your team is going to be using ABM. {#gettingstartedwithabm-stepone--decidewhoonyourteamisgoingtobeusingabm.}

##### Step Two: *Set [Permissions](welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/account-based-marketing/setup-(abm)/permissions.md)* - Assign specific aspects of ABM to certain users, or simply grant full ABM access. {#gettingstartedwithabm-steptwo-set-assignspecificaspectsofabmtocertainusers-orsimplygrantfullabmaccess.}

##### Step Three: *Configure your [Account Score](welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/account-based-marketing/setup-(abm)/account-score.md)* - Account Scoring is one of the key elements in Account Based Marketing. It helps you determine the level of engagement of each account. {#gettingstartedwithabm-stepthree-configureyour-accountscoringisoneofthekeyelementsinaccountbasedmarketing.ithelpsyoudeterminethelevelofengagementofeachaccount.}

##### Step Four: * [Create a Custom Field for CRM Discovery](http://docs.marketo.com/x/1wnG) *- Map an existing CRM Account field to a new Named Account custom field (if you don't use a CRM, skip this step). {#gettingstartedwithabm-stepfour-createacustomfieldforcrmdiscovery-mapanexistingcrmaccountfieldtoanewnamedaccountcustomfield(ifyoudon'tuseacrm-skipthisstep).}

##### Step Five: *Create **Named Accounts* - Named Accounts hold the people from the companies you're targeting. There are four ways to create a named account: {#gettingstartedwithabm-stepfive-createnamedaccounts-namedaccountsholdthepeoplefromthecompaniesyou'retargeting.therearefourwaystocreateanamedaccount-}

* [Import Named Accounts](../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/account-based-marketing/target/named-accounts/import-named-accounts.md) - Upload a list of potential target accounts directly into ABM (this can be a list that you exported from your CRM)
* [Discover CRM Accounts](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Discover+Accounts#DiscoverAccounts-DiscoverCRMAccounts) - View a list of all CRM accounts synced into Marketo and filter using key attributes (i.e. industry) to create named accounts
* [Discover Marketo Companies](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Discover+Accounts#DiscoverAccounts-DiscoverMarketoCompanies) - View a list of companies from sources other than your CRM and filter using key attributes to create named accounts
* [Create a named account manually](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Create+a+Named+Account) - If you create a named account manually, your next step is to [fill it with people](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Add+People+to+a+Named+Account) manually

##### Optional Step: * [Create and set-up Account Lists](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Account+Lists#AccountLists-CreateaNewAccountList)* - Group accounts into lists allowing you to target named accounts by industry, location, or size of the company. {#gettingstartedwithabm-optionalstep-createandset-upaccountlists-groupaccountsintolistsallowingyoutotargetnamedaccountsbyindustry-location-orsizeofthecompany.}

After following the steps above, you are ready to start using ABM! Learn more about utilizing ABM-specific [filters and triggers](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Engage), and [measuring](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Measure) your ABM performance.
