#### Dashboard {#namedaccountinsights-dashboard}

The dashboard aggregates key insights at an account level from all the people within a named account, thus avoiding the need of going to each person to evaluate their progress. You can drill down deeper into email activity using [Email Insights](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Filtering+in+Email+Insights#FilteringinEmailInsights-AccountBasedMarketing).

>[!NOTE]

>Charts show insights from the last 90 days.

**Account Engagement Over Time** Click the **View** drop-down on the right to change what you view by. In addition to Account Score, you can view by Total Revenue...

   <td><p>See week-to-week engagement based on all the account scores you created in Admin. You can compare these account scores side-by-side. To determine weekly engagement, we take the max engagement from any day of the week.</p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>Pipeline</strong></td> 
   <td>See the pipeline over time. To determine pipeline over time by week, we take the pipeline on the last day.</td>

  <tr> 
   <td><strong>Revenue</strong></td>
