Setting up Stars and Flames for Lead/Contact Records - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Stars and Flames on lead/contact records are dependent upon: Lead Score, Relative Score, Urgency, and Priority fields. These fields are available by default after you install and configure the MSI solution. If you don't have Stars and Flames, a prior setup/customization could have resulted in them being removed. Follow the steps below to add them.

##### 1. In Microsoft Dynamics, click the Sales drop-down and select Settings. Click Customizations, then Customize the System. {#settingupstarsandflamesforlead/contactrecords-inmicrosoftdynamics-clickthesalesdrop-downandselectsettings.clickcustomizations-thencustomizethesystem.}
