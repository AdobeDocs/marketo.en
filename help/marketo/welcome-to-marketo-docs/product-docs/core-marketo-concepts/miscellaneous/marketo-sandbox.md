Marketo Sandbox - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

A Marketo sandbox is an additional instance used for testing purposes before implementation in the production environment.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Availability**

>Not all customers have purchased this feature. Please contact your Customer Success Manager for details.

A Marketo sandbox cannot be synced to your regular CRM if it's already synced to your production instance. Use your CRM's sandbox for the sync, and follow [all the same steps](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/CRM+Sync) as the original sync.  

#### Things to Know About Sandboxes  
{#marketosandbox-thingstoknowaboutsandboxes}

##### Once your Customer Success Manager has your sandbox set up and sends you the invite, you must use a different email address to log-in than your Marketo production instance. {#marketosandbox-onceyourcustomersuccessmanagerhasyoursandboxsetupandsendsyoutheinvite-youmustuseadifferentemailaddresstolog-inthanyourmarketoproductioninstance.}

##### If you wish to add users, the process is the same as [adding users in production](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Managing+Marketo+Users#ManagingMarketoUsers-CreateUsers). Again, they must use a different email address if they already have a Marketo log-in. {#marketosandbox-ifyouwishtoaddusers-theprocessisthesameasaddingusersinproduction.again-theymustuseadifferentemailaddressiftheyalreadyhaveamarketolog-in.}

##### Your Marketo sandbox will start out empty, but have the same features available as your production instance. {#marketosandbox-yourmarketosandboxwillstartoutempty-buthavethesamefeaturesavailableasyourproductioninstance.}

##### You can submit a Support case requesting a one-time instance copy to fill your sandbox. The instance copy will not bring over *everything*, however. Please consult Marketo Support for details. {#marketosandbox-youcansubmitasupportcaserequestingaone-timeinstancecopytofillyoursandbox.theinstancecopywillnotbringovereverything-however.pleaseconsultmarketosupportfordetails.}

##### If you create a program in your sandbox and want to move it to production, you can perform a [program import](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Import+a+Program). {#marketosandbox-ifyoucreateaprograminyoursandboxandwanttomoveittoproduction-youcanperformaprogramimport.}

##### Sandboxes are throttled so production instances aren't adversely affected by testing environments. You can send up to 30 emails a day.
