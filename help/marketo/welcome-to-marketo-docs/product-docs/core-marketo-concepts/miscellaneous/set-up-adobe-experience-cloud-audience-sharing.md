>A HIPAA-ready deployment of a Marketo instance cannot use this integration.

##### 1. In Marketo, click Admin. {#setupadobeexperiencecloudaudiencesharing-inmarketo-clickadmin.}

>For security reasons, you must be an Org Admin for the Adobe Organization that you want to map to. If you're not, the action will fail.

##### 7. If you're *not* already logged in, a pop-up will appear in a new tab/window. Log-in to your Adobe org (this action validates the org access). {#setupadobeexperiencecloudaudiencesharing-ifyou'renotalreadyloggedin-apop-upwillappearinanewtab/window.log-intoyouradobeorg(thisactionvalidatestheorgaccess).}

And that's it! You can now begin [sharing audience data](http://docs.marketo.com/x/ogI6Ag).
