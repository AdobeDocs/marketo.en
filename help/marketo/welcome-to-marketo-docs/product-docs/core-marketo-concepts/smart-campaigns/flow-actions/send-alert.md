Send Alert - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

#### Overview {#sendalert-overview}

Marketo can send an email alert with person information to anyone - the sales owner, a partner, or someone else. Use the **Send Alert** flow step.

>[!TIP]
>
>`In trigger campaigns, you can use tokens in`**To Other Emails** `such as {{lead.Territory Owner}} or {{my.Alert Recipient}} as long as the values are valid email addresses. Tokens in`**To Other Emails** `will not work in a batch campaign.`

That's it! Now you know how to use the **Send Alert** flow step.
