   #### Use a Saved Filter as an Overlay {#usingaglobaloverlay-useasavedfilterasanoverlay}

   If you've [saved a filter in the Marketing Calendar](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/marketing-calendar/working-with-the-calendar/saving-a-filter-definition-in-the-marketing-calendar.md), you can use it as an overlay in the program schedule view. 

1. Click the **Overlay** drop-down and select your filter definition.
