   Besides the detailed dashboard, an advantage to using an [email program](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs.md) instead of a smart campaign is the ability to easily implement an [A/B test](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test---a/b-test/add-an-a/b-test.md). Enjoy!
