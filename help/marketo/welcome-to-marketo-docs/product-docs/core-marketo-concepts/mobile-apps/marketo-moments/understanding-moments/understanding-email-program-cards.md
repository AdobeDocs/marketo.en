#### Email Program Cards {#understandingemailprogramcards-emailprogramcards}

`<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n8JTSZI22Do" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>` When you tap any Email Program card you can:

* [Make an email a favorite](../../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/creating-a-favorite.md)
* [Mark an email as done](../../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/marking-it-done.md)
* [Share an email moment card](../../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/sharing-a-moment.md)

On an email program card for an email that's not sent yet, you'll find information about that email program's status and audience.

After the email has been sent, the card displays other valuable information, including the number of delivered emails, the recipients' actions, and a link to the smart list used in the campaign.
