Marking it Done - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Mark an email program, event, or analytics card as Done to remove it from your stream. There are two ways to do it.

##### 1. Tap the action menu.  {#markingitdone-taptheactionmenu.}

>[!NOTE]

>Marking a card as Done doesn't delete the email, event, or smart campaign. It only moves it from the Moments/Later stream into the Done stream.

Piece of cake!
