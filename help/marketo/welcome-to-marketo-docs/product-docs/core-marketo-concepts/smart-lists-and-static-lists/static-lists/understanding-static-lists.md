Understanding Static Lists - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

Static lists are one of the most simple and useful features of Marketo. They are simply a list of names from your Database. You will find plenty of reasons to use them.

>A single person in the database can be in many different static lists.

The difference between a Static and Smart List is crucial to understand. 

| Type |Logic |
|---|---|
| Smart List |Based on **defined rules** |
| Static List |Based on **adding/removing each person** |

>[!CAUTION]
>
>One of the most common mistakes is thinking you can remove a person from a list by simply "deleting the person." **This is wrong.** `Deleting the person will delete them from **the entire database**, not just the list.`

#### Ways to Add/Remove People from a List {#understandingstaticlists-waystoadd/removepeoplefromalist}

1. Smart campaign flow step ([Add to List](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/flow-actions/add-to-list.md), [Remove from List](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/flow-actions/remove-from-list.md))

1. [Single action flow step](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/using-smart-lists/run-a-single-flow-step-from-a-smart-list.md)
1. Dragging people into a list in the tree
1. [List import](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/getting-started/quick-wins/import-a-list-of-people.md)

#### Some Uses of a Static List {#understandingstaticlists-someusesofastaticlist}

* A list that has been pre-selected to receive a marketing message.
* A "competitors" list that you use to send mischievous counter-intelligence messages.
* A temporary list of people in a particular state, who are then removed by smart campaigns when they exit that state.

Enjoy the power of the LIST!
