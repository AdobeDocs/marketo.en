Find Duplicate People with Custom Logic - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Marketo has a system smart list that finds duplicate people by matching their email addresses. If you want to use another field to find duplicates with, here's how.

>**FYI**

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).
