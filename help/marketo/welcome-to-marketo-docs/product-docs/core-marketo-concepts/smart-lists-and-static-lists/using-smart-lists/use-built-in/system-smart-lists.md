>**FYI**

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

   >The filters in system smart lists do not need to be applied to each smart list/campaign. Their contents are automatically recognized.

   | List Name |Description |

   | All People |All people in your Marketo database |
   | Unsubscribed People |These people can only be sent operational emails; this is usually controlled by the person themselves. |
   | Marketing Suspended |These people can only be sent operational emails; this is usually controlled by you, the marketer. |
   | Blacklist |These people will not receive any email at all. |
   | Bounced Email Addresses |People with an undeliverable email address or that reject your email. |
   | Possible Duplicates |People that might be duplicated in the Marketo database. |
