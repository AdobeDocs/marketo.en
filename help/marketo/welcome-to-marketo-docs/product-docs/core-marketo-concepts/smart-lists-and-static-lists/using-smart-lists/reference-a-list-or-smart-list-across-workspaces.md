Reference a List or Smart List Across Workspaces - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Lists and smart lists can be shared and referenced across workspaces for easy reuse from the Database.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Person partition rules apply (smart lists and static lists in a workspace only show people who are both members of the list *and* members of the current workspace).
