Filter Web Campaigns - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

After you've created hundreds of Web Personalization campaigns, it really helps to be able to use filters to view only the ones you're interested in.

1. Go to **Web Campaigns.**

   ##### On the Web Campaigns page, click Filter. {#filterwebcampaigns-onthewebcampaignspage-clickfilter.}

   ![](assets/web-campaigns-page-filter-hand.jpg)

   ##### Check the checkbox for the Status and/or Type of campaign you want to filter for, for example, Paused or Dialog. Click Apply. {#filterwebcampaigns-checkthecheckboxforthestatusand/ortypeofcampaignyouwanttofilterfor-forexample-pausedordialog.clickapply.}

   >Use the **Select All** checkbox to choose all or the **Clear** link to clear all checkboxes.

   ##### Now, only campaigns that match your filter are displayed. {#filterwebcampaigns-now-onlycampaignsthatmatchyourfilteraredisplayed.}
