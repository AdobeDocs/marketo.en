Prioritizing Web Campaigns - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Prioritize your web campaigns when two or more web campaigns overlap by setting a Priority Score.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Overlapping Campaigns**
>
>A web campaign overlap occurs when:
>
>* `<li><p>Two or more Widgets and/or Dialog campaigns react at the same time on the same page</p></li>` `<li><span>Two or more In Zones with the same zone id react at the same time on the same web page</span></li>` 
>
>`An In Zone campaign and a (Widget or Dialog) campaign can react on the same page.`

##### 1. Go to Web Campaigns. {#prioritizingwebcampaigns-1.gotowebcampaigns.}

>[!NOTE]
>
>To make it easier to find the web campaign you want, use the [filter feature](filter-web-campaigns.md).

##### 2. In the Edit Campaign Page, set the Priority Score (9999 = Highest Priority 1 = Lowest Priority). {#prioritizingwebcampaigns-2.intheeditcampaignpage-setthepriorityscore(9999=highestpriority1=lowestpriority).}

>[!TIP]
>
>We recommend that you use campaign Priority Score only if there is a potential campaign overlap, with a higher importance of one of the campaigns. `You don't have to set a priority for every campaign.`

##### 3. Save or Launch the campaign. {#prioritizingwebcampaigns-3.saveorlaunchthecampaign.}

##### 4. See the Priority Score displayed in the Web Campaigns page. {#prioritizingwebcampaigns-4.seethepriorityscoredisplayedinthewebcampaignspage.}
