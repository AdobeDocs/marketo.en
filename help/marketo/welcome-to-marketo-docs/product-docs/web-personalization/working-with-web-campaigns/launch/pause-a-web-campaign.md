Launch/Pause a Web Campaign - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

A web campaign is a customized reaction associated with a specific segment and can be a [dialog box](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/web-personalization/working-with-web-campaigns/create-a-new-dialog-web-campaign.md) on your website, an [in zone replacement](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/web-personalization/working-with-web-campaigns/create-a-new-in-zone-web-campaign.md), a widget feature, or an email alert.

You can launch or pause a web campaign in two ways from the Web Campaigns page or Set Web Campaigns page.

##### 1. Click Web Personalization. {#launch/pauseawebcampaign-clickwebpersonalization.}
