***Quarterly Releases*** The following features were released on **February 21, 2020**.

#### Core Marketo Engage {#releasenotes-feb'20-coremarketoengage}

Please contact your Marketo Engage representative to learn how to get access to this enhancement.
* **Landing Page Redirect Rules APIs**: Automate management of landing page redirect rules. This is an enhancement to our API Calls capability.

* **Saving Filters**: Save dashboard-specific filters unique to each user to analyze your dashboards quickly and consistently.
* **Export to PDF**: Share valuable insights across your organization by exporting Bizible Dashboards as PDFs.

#### Sales Connect  {#releasenotes-feb'20-salesconnect}

* **Compose Window Updates**: We've streamlined the process for selecting templates and sending emails through Sales Connect. Use the Compose window in our web client and Salesforce as a one-stop shop for sellers, with the ability to save template categories, schedule emails, send emails in bulk, and send emails with view and click tracking.
* **Command Center Updates**: We're rebuilding the Sales Connect Command Center to give sellers insight into all of their Emails, Calls, and Tasks that have been initiated from Sales Connect. They can also view information like email engagement and deliverability all from the Command Center.

#### Announcements {#releasenotes-feb'20-announcements}

* **Marketo Engage Success Center**: We're launching the Marketo Success Center in February 2020. The Success Center is an in-product help center that enables you to search Product Docs and the Community, launch how-to guides, access adoption content such as Marketo University and peer best practice videos, and more - right from your Marketo Engage instance. **Note**: This feature will be launched as a beta in ANZ, and will roll out to North America later in the quarter.

#### Deprecations {#releasenotes-feb'20-deprecations}

* **Asset API "_method" Parameter**: After September 2020, Asset API Endpoints will no longer accept "_method" to pass Query Parameters in a POST body to bypass URI length limitations. To accommodate requests which required this parameter, the URI limit for Asset APIs will be increased from 6KiB to 65KiB, so that long request URIs may be submitted.
* **Internet Explorer Support Deprecation**: Beginning with our July release on July 31, 2020, the Marketo Engage user interface will no longer be supported on Internet Explorer.
