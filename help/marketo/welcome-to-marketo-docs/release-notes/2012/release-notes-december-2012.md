#### Forward to Friend {#releasenotes-december2012-forwardtofriend}

Enable the sharing of content with others by including a **Forward to Friend** link in your emails. The addition of new filters and triggers will help you identify your influencers, by identifying users who forwarded an email, as well as those who received the forwarded emails.

To include a **Forward to Friend** invitation in your email, open it in the editor and insert the {{system.forwardToFriendLink}} token.

#### Granular Admin Permissions {#releasenotes-december2012-granularadminpermissions}

Our newest release gives you greater access and control over Admin roles, by controlling access to different functions in the Marketo Admin area for each role. When you create a new role, you can assign specific Admin functions that role may access.
