#### Snippet Previewer {#releasenotes-march2012-snippetpreviewer}

Selecting “Preview Snippet” from the menu allows you to view a Snippet, without making it a draft.Furthermore, if you have read only access to a shared snippet (via workspaces), you can view the snippet with this action

#### Send multiple test emails {#releasenotes-march2012-sendmultipletestemails}

With the addition of dynamic content, it becomes increasingly more important to preview and test all the variations of the emails that might be sent to your leads. When you are previewing using View by Lead Detail, you have the option to send a test for the variations from the lead list (up to 100 test emails).

#### Dynamic Landing Pages based on URL parameter {#releasenotes-march2012-dynamiclandingpagesbasedonurlparameter}

Anonymous leads make up a significant amount of your landing pages visits. With the addition of dynamic content and the ability to put segmentation into your URL as a parameter, you can dynamically display your landing page content when an anonymous or known lead clicks on the link.
