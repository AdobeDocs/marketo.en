#### Segmentation  {#releasenotes-jan/feb2012-segmentation}

*Available for Pro and Enterprise Versions*

Segmentation is a group of segments, which are a targeted group of individuals to whom you market. Segments are defined by rules that are driven by filter criteria similar to smart lists. Your segments can be based on demographic data, such as job title or industry, or based on behaviors such as web pages visited or clicked links.
