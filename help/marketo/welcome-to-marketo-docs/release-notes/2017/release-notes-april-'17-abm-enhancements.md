#### Synching of CRM-Mapped Standard Fields {#releasenotes-april'17abmenhancements-synchingofcrm-mappedstandardfields}

Marketo ABM is changing behavior related to CRMs. Going forward, Marketo ABM establishes and maintains a 1-to-1 relationship between ABM accounts and accounts in the CRM. This allows Marketo to keep mapped account fields in sync with the CRM.

#### Custom Fields for CRM Discovery {#releasenotes-april'17abmenhancements-customfieldsforcrmdiscovery}

You now can add custom fields to accounts, map them to your CRM, and use them for CRM Account Discovery in Marketo.
