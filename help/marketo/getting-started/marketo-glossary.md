| **Known Person** |Any person data in the Marketo **database** is considered known person data. There are a variety of ways for someone to enter your database, including: CRM sync, filling out a form, list import/manual entry, programmatic (rest API/partner integrations), and more. Web visitors are initially **cookied** (and are anonymous) via Marketo's **Munchkin** web-tracking and are then subsequently mapped to the corresponding known person record when identifiable action occurs (e.g., clicked a tracked link in a Marketo email, filled out a form with their email address, or are mapped manually through the Marketo associate lead APIs in both [Munchkin](http://developers.marketo.com/javascript-api/lead-tracking/api-reference/#munchkin_associatelead) and [REST API](http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Leads/associateLeadUsingPOST). |
