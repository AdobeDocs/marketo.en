## Holy cow! Do I need to learn all that? {#holy-cow-do-i-need-to-learn-all-that}

No, not at all. Marketo is easy to get started and will evolve with you. You can add pieces over time.  

## Do I need to do any setup? {#do-i-need-to-do-any-setup}

Yes, we made a [checklist of stuff to do](/help/marketo/getting-started/setup-steps/setup-checklist.md).  

## Do I have to wait until setup is finished to learn? {#do-i-have-to-wait-until-setup-is-finished-to-learn}

Nope! We made a bunch of easy tutorials. [Get started here](/help/marketo/getting-started/quick-wins/get-set-up-and-add-a-person.md). They should take about an hour. You can start any time.

## Why am I still asking questions? {#why-am-i-still-asking-questions}
