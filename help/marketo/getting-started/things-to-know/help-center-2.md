# Help Center {#help-center}

The Help Center in Adobe Marketo Engage serves as a centralized location for getting assistance. In addition to linking out to various resources (e.g., [product documentation](/help/marketo/home.md){target="_blank"}, [release information](/help/marketo/release-notes/current.md){target="_blank"}, the [Marketing Nation Community](https://nation.marketo.com/){target="_blank"}), you can access helpful in-product walkthroughs organized by experience level.

## How to Access {#how-to-access}

There are two different experiences, depending on if your subscription has been migrated to Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) yet.

### Pre-Adobe IMS Migration {#pre-adobe-ims-integration}

These steps are for Marketo Engage users who have _not_ been migrated to [Adobe IMS](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/marketo-with-adobe-identity/adobe-identity-management-overview.md) yet.
