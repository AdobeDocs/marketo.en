# Inherit Doc 5 {#inherit-doc-5}

Now that you've learned the key product areas to audit when inheriting an established instance, the next step is to create/update documentation on your instance configuration and tech stack. Whether creating it via spreadsheet or a project management application, your documentation is a great resource to track progress and record details.
