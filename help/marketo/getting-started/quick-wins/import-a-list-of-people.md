# Import a List of People {#import-a-list-of-people}

## Mission: Import a spreadsheet list of trade show attendees into your database {#mission-import-a-spreadsheet-list-of-trade-show-attendees-into-your-database}

>[!PREREQUISITES]

>[Get Set Up and Add a Person](/help/marketo/getting-started/quick-wins/get-set-up-and-add-a-person.md){target="_blank"}

In this tutorial, you learn how to import people from a spreadsheet file into Marketo.

## Step 1: Download and Edit a Spreadsheet {#step-download-and-edit-a-spreadsheet}

1. To start, download our practice spreadsheet file ([**tradeshow-attendees.csv**](/help/marketo/getting-started/assets/tradeshow-attendees.csv){target="_blank"}) to your computer.

   ![](assets/import-a-list-of-people-1.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When importing a date, use this format: **9/21/20** (Month/Day/Year).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Any date/time fields being imported are treated as Central Time. If you have date/time fields in a different time zone, you can use an Excel formula to transform it to Central Time (America/Chicago).

1. Add your own first name, last name, actual email address (so you can receive the nurturing emails you'll send in the next mission), and job title. Save the file on your computer.

   ![](assets/import-a-list-of-people-2.png)

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >* Make sure email addresses contain ASCII characters only.
   >
   >* Marketo does **not** support email addresses that contain emojis.
   >
   >* Importing `NULL` values via CSV could generate a "Change Data Value" for numeric fields in a person's [activity log](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/managing-people-in-smart-lists/locate-the-activity-log-for-a-person.md){target="_blank"}, _even if the fields are already blank_. If you have any [Smart Campaigns](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/understanding-smart-campaigns.md){target="_blank"} that use the "Data Value Changed" filter or "Data Value Changes" trigger, it could cause people to qualify for those campaigns even though the data is not actually changing. You can use [constraints](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/using-smart-lists/add-a-constraint-to-a-smart-list-filter.md){target="_blank"} to ensure nobody qualifies for those campaigns upon import.

## Step 2: Create a Program {#step-create-a-program}

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Marketing Activities]** area.

   ![](assets/import-a-list-of-people-10.png)

   >[!CAUTION]

   ![](assets/import-a-list-of-people-11.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >In List Import Mode, choosing **[!UICONTROL Skip new people and updates]** means you will not impact existing person records or log any activities. Use this mode if you want a quick, pre-filtered static list of existing people for use in your marketing activities. Selecting this mode will:
   >
   > * Skip new person creation
   > * Skip person field updates
   > * Skip activity logging

1. Map your [!UICONTROL List Column] fields to their respective Marketo Field and click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

   ![](assets/import-a-list-of-people-12.png)

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Column headers should always match the field exactly (case sensitive) to achieve the best auto-mapping results. If you're using custom fields and don't see them in the drop-down, go back and [create them](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/field-management/create-a-custom-field-in-marketo.md){target="_blank"} so they can become options.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If there are any fields you don't want to import, select **Ignore** in the Marketo Field drop-down menu.

1. Select **My Tradeshow Program** for the **[!UICONTROL Acquisition Program]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Import]**.

   ![](assets/import-a-list-of-people-13.png)
