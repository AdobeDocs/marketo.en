## Do I need to learn all of that? {#do-i-need-to-learn-all-of-that}

You do not. It's easy to get started in Marketo Engage, and it will evolve with you. You can learn everything if you'd like, or just use the pieces that suit your needs.

## Do I need to do any setup? {#do-i-need-to-do-any-setup}

Yes, there are a handful of steps you must (or we strongly recommend you) do, and [they can be found here](/help/marketo/getting-started/initial-setup/setup-steps.md){target="_blank"}.  

## Do I have to wait until setup is finished to learn? {#do-i-have-to-wait-until-setup-is-finished-to-learn}

Nope! We made a bunch of easy tutorials. [Get started here](/help/marketo/getting-started/quick-wins/get-set-up-and-add-a-person.md){target="_blank"}. They should take about an hour. You can start any time.

## Is there a list of things that covers limits, like how many total emails I can send in a week? {#list-of-limits}

There is. Static limits (and other parameters) are outlined [in this article](https://helpx.adobe.com/legal/product-descriptions/adobe-marketo-engage---product-description.html#performance-guardrails){target="_blank"}. 

## How long does Marketo hold on to my data? {#data-retention-policy}

Please review [this Marketing Nation blog post](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/knowledgebase/marketo-activities-data-retention-policy-overview-amp-faq/ta-p/250750){target="_blank"} for details.
