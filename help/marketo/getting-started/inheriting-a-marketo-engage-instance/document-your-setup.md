# Inherited Instance: Document Your Setup {#inherited-instance-document-your-setup}

Now that you've learned the key product areas to audit when inheriting an established instance, the next step is to create/update documentation on your instance configuration and tech stack. Whether creating it via spreadsheet or a project management application, your documentation will be a great resource to track progress and record details, as well as keep your instance structured and sustainable.
