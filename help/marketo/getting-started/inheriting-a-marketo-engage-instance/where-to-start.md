Are you starting a new job or taking over an existing instance from another admin and not sure where to start? While taking over a live instance that's been running for some time can seem a little intimidating, we've put together some resources for you to help you get up to speed in no time.

## Merge Your Marketing Nation Profile {#merge-your-marketing-nation-profile}

If you already have a Marketing Nation profile with a previous company, follow these steps to bring that history over to your new profile.

1. Create a username/Community profile with your email address that has access to your current Marketo Engage subscription.

1. [After you create your profile](https://nation.marketo.com/){target="_blank"} with your new company info, submit a request to `ccare@marketo.com` to have the data from your old community profile merged with your new one.

1. In your request, please specify the following details:
