Do you target the same group of leads consistently? If so, use segmentation in your smart lists for targeting leads. With segmentation, your entire lead database is always segmented and it can be re-used across your programs for consistency. Segmentation results are pulled quickly because they do not require the smart list to run at the time of the request.

* The Request Campaign API now allows you to send in values for My Tokens for that particular run of the campaign - this is particularly useful for populating email content via the API
* New Upload To List and Schedule Campaign APIs support the above for lists of leads and batch campaigns ([http://community.marketo.com/MarketoArticle?id=kA050000000Kyr5](#))

## Easier Confirmation Emails for GoToWebinar and WebEx (Adobe Connect and ON24 Coming Soon!) {#easier-confirmation-emails-for-gotowebinar-and-webex-adobe-connect-and-on-coming-soon}

Weâ€™ve simplified the confirmation URL by creating a member token that displays the unique registration confirmation URL for each lead. You will no longer have to create this URL using different tokens. This is currently available for GoToWebinar and WebEx customers, and will be available for Adobe Connect and ON24 in our next release.

## Upload Multiple Images and Files with a Single Click! {#upload-multiple-images-and-files-with-a-single-click}

Save time and be more efficient when importing images and files into Marketo! If you use Firefox or Google Chrome, you can multi-select files and upload them all at once. Although there is no limit to the number of files you can upload, the individual size limit per file is 50MB.

Note: At this time, this feature is not supported on Internet Explorer, due to limitations of the browser.
