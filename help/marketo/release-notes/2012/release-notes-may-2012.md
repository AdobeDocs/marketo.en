## Email Performance Report Redesign {#email-performance-report-redesign}

Note: this will be a staged roll-out, beginning with the May release

We made the Email Performance and Campaign Email Performance reports run faster. We’ve also improved the definitions of certain metrics and consolidated the "Messages Sent" and "Leads Sent" metrics to a single metric, "Sent”. We've merged “Messages Delivered” and “Leads Delivered” to “Delivered”.

## Wait Step Enhancements {#wait-step-enhancements}

Using the new Advanced Wait properties, you can configure the wait step in a Smart Campaign Flow action to “wait until” a specific day of the week, the next business day, a specific date or time. These enhancements ensure your nurture emails arrive in the Inbox during business hours!
