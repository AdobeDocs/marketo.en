## Email Analysis {#email-analysis}

Create advanced email reports in Revenue Explorer such as the Click Activity Heat Grid report. This report will give insight into the day and time people are clicking links in your emails.

The Email Analysis feature as a whole will be turned on in phases during April and May as we migrate your 2012 and 2013 email data. In other words, some customers will have access to this feature sooner than others.
