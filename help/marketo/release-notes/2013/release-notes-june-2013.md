## Multiple Models {#multiple-models}

A top idea for Revenue Cycle Analytics (RCA) in the Community, this feature allows you to create multiple models to have a more detailed understanding of your revenue funnel by product line, business unit, or region. The Leads by Revenue Stage, Success Path Analyzer, Program Analyzer and Revenue Explorer reports now supports the ability to select a specific model for reporting.

By default, two models are available for Select SMB Edition and fifteen models for Enterprise Edition. You may purchase additional models also.
