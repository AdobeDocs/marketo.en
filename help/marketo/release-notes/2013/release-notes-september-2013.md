## Restrict User Login to SSO only {#restrict-user-login-to-sso-only}

Configure subscriptions to only allow Marketo Users to log in through SSO and not through the normal login screen

## Virus Scan of Uploaded Files {#virus-scan-of-uploaded-files}

Files uploaded to the Design Studio are now automatically scanned and blocked if the files contain viruses

## Export Opportunity Influence Analyzer {#export-opportunity-influence-analyzer}

You can now export the data in the Opportunity Influence Analyzer to Excel. Each exported Excel file contains all the marketing interactions for all leads (including those without a role in the opportunity) as well all the opportunities under the selected account in the analyzer. The opportunity rows are highlighted in green. You can use Excel’s native data filtering capabilities if you need to focus on specific leads or marketing activities.

## Program Attribution Settings {#program-attribution-settings}

You can change the way Marketo ties contacts and opportunities for first and multi touch attribution metrics, including the ability to do account-based attribution. These settings will impact attribution metrics in Revenue Explorer reports under the Program Opportunity Analysis area and the Opportunity Analysis area. This will also affect the attribution metrics in Program Analyzer.

You can change the program attribution settings to one of three choices. Changing this setting does not modify any Marketo or CRM data; it simply changes the way your reports run and it can be reverted at any time.

The Explicit setting will only examine contacts with roles (current behavior). Implicit will examine all contacts associated to the account regardless of role. We strongly recommend using the Explicit mode if possible. Using Implicit may create false positives, people with credit for an opportunity despite having no real influence in the opportunity.
