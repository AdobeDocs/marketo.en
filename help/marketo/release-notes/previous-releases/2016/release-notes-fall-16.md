## Marketo Account Based Marketing Enhancements {#marketo-account-based-marketing-enhancements}

**REST API**

This release also enables you to manage named account attributes and accounts scores in ABM using the Marketo REST API. For more details on the API operations, please visit the [Marketo Developers website](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/lead-database/named-accounts).

## [Audit Trail Enhancements](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/audit-trail/change-details-in-audit-trail.md) {#audit-trail-enhancements}

Audit trail provides a comprehensive history of the changes made within your Marketo subscription. We have added additional tracking capabilities for programs as well as surfacing important change details for smart campaigns, smart lists, and changes made to users and roles.

## [New Permissions](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/managing-user-roles-and-permissions/descriptions-of-role-permissions.md) {#new-permissions}

**Make Email Operational**

Gone are the days when you had to worry about users sending transactional emails to people in your database who have unsubscribed. You can now specify which users can make an email operational or edit operational emails.

**Edit Campaign Restrictions**

Why set [campaign restrictions](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/email-setup/enable-person-restrictions-for-smart-campaigns.md) if you can't enforce them? When you set Campaign Limit Settings to restrict the number of people in your database who can be targeted with a single campaign, you now have the ability to restrict which users can override these settings when scheduling a campaign.

## [Sound for Mobile Push Notifications](/help/marketo/product-docs/mobile-marketing/push-notifications/configure-mobile-push-notification.md) {#sound-for-mobile-push-notifications}

Give your iOS Push Notification added richness by enabling sound. This new feature allows you to trigger a sound when you Push Notification is displayed on the mobile device.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Device owners can choose to prevent sounds from being played in the device settings, and app developers can give device owners options within the app to prevent sounds from being played.
>* Sounds are automatically played when a Push Notification is displayed on an Android device.

## [Changes to Marketo [!DNL Salesforce] Sync](https://nation.marketo.com/docs/DOC-3840) {#changes-to-marketo-salesforce-sync}

Marketo’s [!DNL Salesforce] integration is evolving to improve the way that Marketo fields are synced with [!DNL Salesforce]. Now, instead of having to sync a large group of fields that you may or may not need, you can pick and choose which fields you’d like to have included. Check out our documentation here for more information: [https://nation.marketo.com/docs/DOC-3840](https://nation.marketo.com/docs/DOC-3840).
