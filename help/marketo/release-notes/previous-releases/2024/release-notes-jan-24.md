## Announcements {#announcements}

* **One-Click List-Unsubscribe Update**: Gmail and Yahoo have implemented several new sender requirements that took effect on February 1, 2024. Learn [what they are and how they affect you](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/employee-blogs/update-support-for-one-click-list-unsubscribe-for-marketo/ba-p/344514#M352){target="_blank"}.

* **Sync Lead API Update**: The [Sync Lead API](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/lead-database/leads/#create_and_update){target="_blank"}'s behavior has been adjusted slightly concerning updates to the `unsubscribed` field. Now, when you pass `null` as the value, it is equal to passing a value of `false`.

* **Marketo Engage Forms jQuery 1.x**: In our January 2024 release, we'll be updating the jQuery for Marketo Engage Forms to jQuery 3.x. This may impact custom Form implementation relying on older versions of jQuery. [Learn more here](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-blogs/marketo-engage-forms-amp-forms2-js-jquery-update/ba-p/341705){target="_blank"}.

* **Email Verification for SSO Only Users**: SSO Only users used to be automatically verified, allowing them to use an inaccessible email account. Starting in mid-January, all existing SSO Only users will become unverified and be asked to reverify their email via a link we send to the email account. All new SSO Only users will need to verify their email addresses going forward.
