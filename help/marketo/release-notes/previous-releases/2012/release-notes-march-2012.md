## Send multiple test emails {#send-multiple-test-emails}

With the addition of dynamic content, it becomes increasingly more important to preview and test all the variations of the emails that might be sent to your leads. When you are previewing using View by Lead Detail, you have the option to send a test for the variations from the lead list (up to 100 test emails).
