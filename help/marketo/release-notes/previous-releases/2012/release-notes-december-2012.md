# Release Notes: December 2012 {#release-notes-december}

The December release includes the much anticipated **Forward to Friend** feature, as well as several other goodies! Note that features marked with an asterisk (&#42;) are available only in the Select Edition and in RCA (Revenue Cycle Analytics).

## Forward to Friend {#forward-to-friend}

Enable the sharing of content with others by including a **Forward to Friend** link in your emails. The addition of new filters and triggers will help you identify your influencers, by identifying users who forwarded an email, as well as those who received the forwarded emails.

To include a **Forward to Friend** invitation in your email, open it in the editor and insert the `{{system.forwardToFriendLink}}` token.

Use the corresponding triggers and filters to identify users who used the **Forward to Friend** link, and those who received the email.

## Granular Admin Permissions {#granular-admin-permissions}

Our newest release gives you greater access and control over [!UICONTROL Admin] roles, by controlling access to different functions in the Marketo [!UICONTROL Admin] area for each role. When you create a new role, you can assign specific [!UICONTROL Admin] functions that role may access.

## Campaign Inspector {#campaign-inspector}

Have you ever wondered which campaigns are using a specific flow action, such as [!UICONTROL Change Score] or [!UICONTROL Request Campaign]? Or where a certain filter is being used? The new [!UICONTROL Campaign Inspector] (available from the Treasure Chest) enables you to identify these campaigns, as well as active campaigns and campaigns with errors.

Go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Treasure Chest]** to enable the **[!UICONTROL Campaign Inspector]**.
