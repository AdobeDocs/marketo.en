**_Quarterly Releases_**

The following features will start to be released on **March 11, 2022**, with a phased rollout of every feature over the following weeks (unless specified otherwise).

## Cross-Channel Orchestration {#cross-channel-orchestration}

* **[!DNL Dynamic Chat]**: Maximize every opportunity on your website by targeting both leads and accounts with proactive, engaging, and 1:1 personalized conversations. [Dynamic Chat](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/dynamic-chat-overview.md){target="_blank"} allows Marketo Engage users to start leveraging chat as a key part of integrated cross-channel experiences for B2B marketing and sales use cases. Features include: the ability to book meetings directly within the chat, lead routing, starter templates, drag-and-drop conversation creation, and much more. Dynamic Chat is included in all Marketo Engage packages and will be rolled out to all Marketo Engage users this year.

* **Email Bot Activity Filtering Enhancement**: As an enhancement to the previously released [Email Bot Activity Filtering](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/email-setup/filtering-email-bot-activity.md){target="_blank"} feature, you can now opt-in to logging activities that are identified as bots. You can then filter and trigger actions based on activities that are identified as being performed by bots.

## Next-Generation Experience {#modern-ux}

* **Updated Screens in the Next-Generation Experience**: We're delivering additional, refreshed screens in the next-generation experience that offer an updated design and usability enhancements accessible via toggle switch:

  * Form List View in [!UICONTROL Design Studio] (including new bulk actions)

* **Import Program Workflow Update**: The import program workflow is being delivered in the next-generation experience with an updated design and usability enhancements. This will be an automatic change without a toggle switch.

* **Admin Control for the Next-generation Experience Toggle Switch**: Manage the rollout of the next-generation experience in a way that works for your users with the ability for admins to select which user types can access the toggle switch.

## Experience Automation {#experience-automation}

* **Self-Service Flow Steps (Beta)**: Expand connectivity between Marketo Engage and the rest of your stack with the ability to author customized flow steps for use in Smart Campaigns. Both Marketo users and partners can leverage this functionality to allow for the usage of external web services in batch and executable campaigns in contrast to webhooks, which can only be used in trigger campaigns.

* **Asset Expiration**: Maintain control of your time-sensitive assets and campaigns with the ability to schedule their automatic deactivation at a specified date and time in the Classic user experience.

* **Smart Campaign Priority Override**: Ensure that high-priority trigger Smart Campaigns execute as soon as possible with the ability to override the standard campaign priority ranking. Lower-priority trigger Smart Campaigns can also be lowered in priority to free up processing resources for other high-priority tasks.

## API Enhancements {#api-enhancements}

* **Return Disable Open Tracking Status of Emails**: Allows for the reading of open tracking status of emails via API
* **Retrieve Dynamic Content Subject Lines from Email**: Allows marketers to perform analysis of dynamic subject lines in BI tools
* **Program Member Custom Fields CRUD**: Allows marketers to programmatically create program member custom fields
* **Bulk Custom Object Export updatedAt Filter**: Allows marketers to programmatically sync custom objects
* **Expose Head Start Setting for Email Programs**: Allows marketers to configure email programs with head start via API

![(star)](assets/yellow-star.png)

* **Email Connection Throttling (GA)**: Email Connection Throttling allows [!DNL Sales Connect] administrators to configure the send rate of emails when using Gmail or [!DNL Exchange] as your delivery channel, so that the rate at which emails are being handed over to the delivery channel provider do not exceed the enforced limits.

## Announcements {#announcements}

* **Marketo Sky Deprecation**: In March, Marketo Sky will no longer be available as we focus our resources on delivering the next-generation user experience. In an effort to maintain access to functionality that is exclusive to Marketo Sky today, we are bringing Asset Expiration and Smart Campaign Priority Override into the Classic experience.
