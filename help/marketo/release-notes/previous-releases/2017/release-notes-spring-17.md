## [LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/social/social-functions/set-up-linkedin-lead-gen-forms.md) {#linkedin-lead-gen-forms}

[LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/native-advertising/lead-gen-ads) are a more direct way for a business to run lead generation campaigns on LinkedIn. People can fill out forms to express interest in a product or service, enabling the business to capture the person’s details and sync them to Marketo, where automated follow-up processes and lead routing activities can occur.

The Marketo integration with LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms automatically captures the information a lead provides within the Lead Gen form. Follow-up actions and notifications can then be automated using the new **Fills Out LinkedIn Lead Gen Form** trigger and filter.
