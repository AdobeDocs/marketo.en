[Export email metrics to [!DNL Excel]](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-data/export-email-program-dashboard-to-excel.md), including AB Test variant data.

## [!UICONTROL Engagement Score] in [!UICONTROL Engagement Stream Performance] Report {#engagement-score-in-engagement-stream-performance-report}

We added the Engagement Score to the [[!UICONTROL Engagement Stream Performance] Report](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing/reports-and-notifications/engagement-stream-performance-report.md) to help you see how effective the content in your engagement program is.

## Program Details in Email Analysis {#program-details-in-email-analysis}

[Now you can group your email metrics by Program Name, Channel and Tags](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics/email-analysis/build-an-email-analysis-report-that-shows-program-information.md). The program name is added to the Email Name field when the email is a local asset to the Program. The new Program Name field shows the program name of the smart campaign that sent the email. This could be different from the program in the Email Name field if the email is a local asset of a different program.

## Forms 2.0 Enhancements {#forms-enhancements}

We’ve given Forms 2.0 several “quality of life” updates with this release. In addition to enabling progressive profiling on embedded forms, we’ve made workflow and UX changes that will make it easier to use the more advanced functionality in the editor, [including the visibility rules](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/forms/form-fields/dynamically-toggle-visibility-of-a-form-field.md), advanced thank you pages, and hidden fields.
