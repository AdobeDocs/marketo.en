## Delete Workspace {#delete-workspace}

Now you can [delete an unused workspace](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/workspaces-and-person-partitions/delete-a-workspace.md). Be sure to move all assets into another workspace before attempting to delete the workspace.

## Schedule First Cast {#schedule-first-cast}

In engagement programs, you can schedule the date for the [first cast to run](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing/engagement-program-streams/set-stream-cadence.md). For example, specify the cadence to be every 2 weeks and select the date of the first cast.

## Enhanced Engagement Programs {#enhanced-engagement-programs}

Now everyone gets multiple programs, streams and communication limits.

## Link Tracking in Text Emails {#link-tracking-in-text-emails}

[Add double square brackets](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/functions-in-the-editor/add-tracked-links-to-a-text-email.md) around URLs in the text version of your emails to indicate when links should be converted into re-directed Marketo tracking links

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Example**
>
>`[[https://www.marketo.com]]`

By default, no links will be tracked in the text version of emails. Add this new syntax to indicate when a link should be converted into a tracking link. The behavior of HTML links is unchanged.  To add tracked links to your emails:

* **HTML version:** Just insert your link. It will be tracked by default.
* **Text version:** Enter the URL surrounded by double square brackets.

To add untracked links to your emails:

* **HTML version:** Insert your link and add the “mktNoTrack” class to the link.
* **Text version:** Just enter the URL. It will be untracked by default.
