The following features are included in the May 2015 release. Please check your Marketo Edition for feature availability. After the release, be sure to come back to find links to detailed articles for each feature!

## Fully Responsive Landing Pages

[Fully Responsive Landing Pages](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/landing-pages/guided-landing-pages/create-a-guided-landing-page.md)

We're releasing a new landing page editing mode and template syntax. Unlike our "Free-form" landing page editor, the new "Guided" landing page editor will provide a structured editing experience for fully responsive landing pages.

## Abort Email Program

[Abort Email Program](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/abort-email-program.md)

Did you hit send before an email program was ready to go out? Pull the brakes with the new abort email program button. This will stop in-flight email programs right in their tracks.

## Email Deliverability  {#email-deliverability}

Marketo will now run weekly automated [!DNL SPF] and [!DNL DKIM] checks on your added domains. Stay on top of this by checking your notifications.

## Email Template Behavior Change {#email-template-behavior-change}

As of this release, valid HTML comments are now allowed and not stripped out when creating new emails.
