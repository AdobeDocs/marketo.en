# Release Notes: December 2013 {#release-notes-december}

The following features are included in the December release.

After the release, be sure to check out the New Release tab in the Community for detailed Knowledge Base articles for each feature!

## Email Program {#email-program}

Sending an email has never been easier. Use the new [email program](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/creating-an-email-program/understanding-email-programs.md) to send a batch email, instead of the Default Program. Define the smart list, email, schedule it, and you are off!

Also check out the new [Email Metrics Dashboard](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-data/view-the-email-program-dashboard.md) to see how your email performed.

## Email A/B Testing {#email-a-b-testing}

In the new Email Program, run an [A/B test](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/add-an-a-b-test.md) on a percentage of the overall email send population. Choose from 4 different types of tests: Subject line, From Address, Date/Time, and Whole Email. You can even choose to manually promote the winner, or let the system promote it based on a pre-defined winning criteria. The new Email program, including A/B test, can be nested in Events and the default Program to make that email send so simple!

## Email Champion/Challenger Testing {#email-champion-challenger-testing}

[Champion/Challenger testing](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/functions-in-the-editor/email-tests-champion-challenger/add-an-email-champion-challenger.md) is similar to A/B test, but the difference is that it is used for triggered emails and you donâ€™t automatically send a winner. This test allows you to challenge an established way of doing something, called the Champion, and you test if it is still the best by introducing a Challenger. In addition, Champion/Challenger Email Tests can be used inside Engagement program streams.

## Lead Details in [!UICONTROL Email Analysis] {#lead-details-in-email-analysis}

We introduced additional lead and company attributes in [!UICONTROL Email Analysis]. You can now view your email stats grouped by new attributes such as [!UICONTROL Industry] and [!UICONTROL Lead Source].
