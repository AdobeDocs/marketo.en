As of then, users have been unable to create, clone, or embed any of those Social features in Marketo Engage. Existing Social assets continue to work through January 31, 2025.

[Learn more](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/employee-blogs/marketo-engage-social-features-deprecation/ba-p/351977){target="_blank"}

* **Rest API 'access_token' Parameter Deprecation**: The `access_token` query parameter used to authenticate Marketo REST API calls is being deprecated and will not be available after October 31, 2025. All new and existing integrations should authenticate REST API calls using the 'Authorization' header, [as described here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/authentication){target="_blank"}.

* **SOAP API Deprecation**: Support for the Marketo SOAP API will end on October 31, 2025. Services which use SOAP API capabilities should be migrated to the [REST API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/rest-api){target="_blank"}.

* **New Analytics Feature - Public Beta**: [Advanced BI Analytics](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/advanced-bi-analytics/overview.md){target="_blank"} (formerly known as Revenue Explorer and Advanced Report Builder) begins rolling out to all current Revenue Cycle Explorer users in mid-April. This new tool offers a flexible reporting and visualization interface on Marketo Engage data, providing granular details about progression, performance, and more. It features richer interactivity and visualization, faster performance, and a more seamless and intuitive user experience.

To access this feature, you must have purchased the Advanced BI Analytics add-on. Please contact the Adobe Account Team (your Account Manager) for details.
