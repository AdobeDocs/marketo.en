## Fully Responsive Landing Pages

[Fully Responsive Landing Pages](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/landing-pages/guided-landing-pages/create-a-guided-landing-page.md)

We're releasing a new landing page editing mode and template syntax. Unlike our "Free-form" landing page editor, the new "Guided" landing page editor will provide a structured editing experience for fully responsive landing pages.
