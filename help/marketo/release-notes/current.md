## Announcements {#announcements}
 
* **Upgrade to Google Analytics 4**: Marketo previously supported Universal Analytics, which will stop recording data by July 1, 2023. RTP users will need to follow the migration process in their Google Analytics dashboard to complete support for the Google Analytics 4 integration in RTP. Going forward, users will have a unique alphanumeric tag (located within the `<head>` section of the html) in their landing pages that allows Marketo to send data to Google Analytics.
