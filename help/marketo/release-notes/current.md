## Announcements {#announcements}

* **Switching Back to Velocity Scripting in the new Email Designer**: Adobe Marketo Engage released a feature called _Conditional Content_ for the new Email Designer this past June. The feature was powered by Handlebar scripting instead of Velocity scripting, in an effort to provide a little more flexibility in your dynamic content. But when we discovered it was causing some tokens to be resolved incorrectly, we decided to temporarily disable it. [Learn More](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-blogs/update-on-email-scripting-in-the-new-email-designer/ba-p/358179){target="_blank"}

* **Marketo Engage Identity End of Life**: In August 2025, Adobe began phasing out support for Marketo Engage Identity (logging in via `login.marketo.com`). To prevent interrupted access to Marketo Engage, you must transition to [Adobe Identity](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/marketo-with-adobe-identity/adobe-identity-management-overview){target="_blank"} no later than September 30, 2025.

  * _IP Restrictions Deprecation_: Support for [Restricting Marketo Logins Based on IP](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/settings/restrict-marketo-logins-based-on-ip){target="_blank"} ended on July 30, 2025. The feature will remain operational until the transition to Adobe Identity is complete. A new location-based access control feature for Adobe Identity in the Adobe Admin Console is coming soon.

  * _Single Sign-On (SSO) Deprecation_: Support for [Marketo Identity SSO](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/additional-integrations/add-single-sign-on-to-a-portal){target="_blank"} ended on July 30, 2025. The feature will remain operational until the transition to Adobe Identity is complete. Single Sign-On for Adobe Identity in the Adobe Admin Console must be configured separately. For setup steps, see [Set up identity and Single Sign-On](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/set-up-identity.html){target="_blank"}.

* **Deprecation of _Forward to a Friend_ Feature**: On September 29, 2025, the _Forward to a Friend_ feature in Marketo Engage 2.0 emails (the legacy email editor) will be completely deprecated for all subscriptions. This affects the 'Forward to a Friend' token and 'Forward to a Friend' links in emails that have already been or will be sent using the token. [Learn more](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-blogs/deprecation-of-forward-to-a-friend/ba-p/358045#M2889){target="_blank"}

* **Rest API 'access_token' Parameter Deprecation**: The `access_token` query parameter used to authenticate Marketo REST API calls is being deprecated and will not be available after January 31, 2026. All new and existing integrations should authenticate REST API calls using the 'Authorization' header, [as described here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/authentication){target="_blank"}.

* **SOAP API Deprecation**: Support for the Marketo SOAP API will end on January 31, 2026. Services which use SOAP API capabilities should be migrated to the [REST API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/rest-api){target="_blank"}.
