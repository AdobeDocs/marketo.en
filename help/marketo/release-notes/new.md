## Announcements {#announcements}
 
There are two enhancements coming to Marketo Engage Real-Time Personalization. 

* **Upgrade to Google Analytics 4**: RTP users will have a unique alphanumeric tag (located in the within the `<head>` section of the html) in their landing pages that allows Marketo to send data to Google Analytics. Marketo previously utilized Universal Analytics, which will stop recording data by 1st July 2023. RTP users will need to follow the migration process in their Google Analytics dashboard to complete the migration. 

* **Upgrade to jQuery 3.7**: To enhance security and stability, Marketo is upgrading to jQuery 3.7.0. RTP users who load jQuery on their own may be negatively impacted if they're using a version older than 3.0.0. Those users can reach out to Marketo Support for help implementing a specific version of rtp.js to fit their needs. If you're using version 3.0.0 or later, you will not be impacted.
