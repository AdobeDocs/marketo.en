**_Quarterly Releases_**

The following features were released on August 16, 2019.

## Core Marketo Engage {#core-marketo-engage}

* **Extensible Webinar Framework**: Save time with Marketo's new out-of-the-box webinar framework (introduced in the [Winter ‘19 release notes](/help/marketo/release-notes/2019/release-notes-winter-19.md) that seamlessly passes data from webinar providers into Marketo and vice versa. Cvent and Zoom are now available in this new framework.
* **Smart Campaign API Update**: Manage smart campaign lifecycle capabilities as we round out the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) interface.
* **Update Email Headers API Change**: The Update Email Header API no longer requires an email to have an attached template to update header fields, such as subject line.

**Account-Based Marketing** ![(star)](assets/star-yellow.svg)
