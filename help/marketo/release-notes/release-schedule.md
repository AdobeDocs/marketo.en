# Release Schedule {#release-schedule}

**Release**: Marketo uses a quarterly major release schedule. Once available, each of the release notes will be linked in the table below.

**Progress**:

* On Schedule - We're planning to release the quarterly features and enhancements on the indicated date
* In Progress - We're developing and documenting the content now for release on the indicated date
* Shipped - The release is complete
