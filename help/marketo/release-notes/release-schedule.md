# Release Schedule {#release-schedule}

**Release**: Marketo uses a quarterly major release schedule. Once available, each of the release notes will be linked in the table below.

**Release Date**: Rollout typically begins on Tuesday of release week, with the bulk of the upgrade happening Friday evening. An email is sent out with specific dates and release details. The date listed is for the Friday update.

**Progress**:

* On Schedule - We're planning to release the quarterly features and enhancements on the indicated date
* In Progress - We're developing and documenting the content now for release on the indicated date
* Shipped - The release is complete

_Release dates are subject to change_
