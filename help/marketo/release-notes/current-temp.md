## Adobe Connect Features {#adobe-connect-features}

These features have already been released by the Adobe Connect team. Marketo Engage [Interactive Webinars](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/demand-generation/events/interactive-webinars/interactive-webinars-overview){target="_blank"} are powered by Adobe Connect. As such, the features below are only applicable to Interactive Webinars users.

* **Resources Pod**: The new Resources Pod replaces the previous Files and Web Links pods, providing a single, unified way to share resources during live sessions.

* **Enhanced Room Interface Experience**: Adobe Connect 12.11 introduces a refreshed and more modern room interface, built on Adobe's latest Spectrum 2 design framework, aligning with the visual language used across other Adobe products such as Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud.
