Touchpoint Generation and Mapping - Bizible - Product Documentation

Bizible’s attribution stories hinge on two processes:

* Touchpoint generation, which creates touchpoints that represent a person’s interactions with your marketing and sales efforts
* Touchpoint mapping, which credits touchpoints to the appropriate channel and subchannel

In order for you to get the most out of Bizible, you should work with your Bizible rep to customize both processes to suit your organization’s needs.

##### Touchpoint Generation Methods  
  
The touchpoint generation process answers the question, “How is Bizible going to know that this occurred?” Depending on your feature set and the types of interactions your prospective customers can have, there are up to three ways Bizible can pick up on an interaction and create a touchpoint to represent it. {#touchpointgenerationandmapping-touchpointgenerationmethodsthetouchpointgenerationprocessanswersthequestion-“howisbiziblegoingtoknowthatthisoccurred?”dependingonyourfeaturesetandthetypesofinteractionsyourprospectivecustomerscanhave-thereareuptothreewaysbiz}

##### Touchpoint Mapping Methods  
  
The touchpoint mapping process answers the question, “Once this touchpoint’s been created, how is Bizible going to know what channel and subchannel it belongs to?” Each method of touchpoint generation has its own method of touchpoint mapping. {#touchpointgenerationandmapping-touchpointmappingmethodsthetouchpointmappingprocessanswersthequestion-“oncethistouchpoint’sbeencreated-howisbiziblegoingtoknowwhatchannelandsubchannelitbelongsto?”eachmethodoftouchpointgenerationhasitsownmethodoftouchpointma}
