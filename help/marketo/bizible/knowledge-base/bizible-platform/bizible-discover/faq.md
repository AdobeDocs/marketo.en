##### How do I save the filters on a report? {#faq-howdoisavethefiltersonareport?}

Like today, query results are saved into the URL and can be saved or shared with the copied URL.

##### How do I use pre-set date ranges like Last Year or Current Quarter? {#faq-howdoiusepre-setdaterangeslikelastyearorcurrentquarter?}

Rather than using pre-set date ranges, we now have added date flexibility. You can still set Last Year, but you have the option of selecting Last 1 Year which is the last 365 days from today or Last 1 Complete Year which is the last full year from 1/1 to 12/31. Other good uses of the new date picker is to set a relative date range, which will tend to give a rolling time window for a moving date.

##### How do I get CPL or CPC data? {#faq-howdoigetcplorcpcdata?}

These metrics can be found on the Paid Media board only.

##### Why don’t you show Page Views on the Growth board? {#faq-whydon’tyoushowpageviewsonthegrowthboard?}

One of the features of the Growth board is that you can’t group the trending charts by a dimension, like Channel or Campaign. We don’t have that data available at a Page View level since Page Views don’t always have a source like Channel or Campaign because they happen in the middle of web visits. Use Paid Media or Web Traffic to view Page Views data.

##### When I change the grouping, the totals don’t always equal the same amount. Why is that? {#faq-whenichangethegrouping-thetotalsdon’talwaysequalthesameamount.whyisthat?}

Values don’t exist for every single hierarchy of data because the hierarchy isn’t always a clear cut flow. For example, whether the costs are being self reported or imported from an ads provider, the total cost for Channel 1 might be $10,000 but by individual campaign, only a total of $5,500 was actually reported, so when the grouping changes between Channel and Campaign, the totals will vary.

##### What is “matches a user attribute” in the Filter operators? {#faq-whatis“matchesauserattribute”inthefilteroperators?}

User attributes are applied to users such as business Id, first name, or last name, but because our users are you (our customers), and not your customers, user attributes actually can not be used in the Bizible Discover experience. Please feel free to ignore this option. We are working on a better custom filter experience that will remove filters that don’t apply to our customers.

##### How come some default date ranges go through the first of the following month? {#faq-howcomesomedefaultdaterangesgothroughthefirstofthefollowingmonth?}

While the date range isn’t always intuitive, the default filter UI has the helpful “before” text that corresponds with the end date, so this should help remind you that end date that you use should be 1 day outside of your desired range.

##### What Attribution Model is used for Leads and Contacts? {#faq-whatattributionmodelisusedforleadsandcontacts?}

Bizible Touchpoints that are mapped to Leads and Contacts measure up to the Lead Creation touch, so the First Touch, Lead Creation, and U-Shaped model are recommended. If you change the Attribution Model to W-Shaped or Full Path, we automatically apply a U-Shaped model for Leads and Contacts.

##### Why are my Visits, Unique Visits, and Forms tiles blank on the Growth board? {#faq-whyaremyvisits-uniquevisits-andformstilesblankonthegrowthboard?}

If these tiles happen to be 0 or blank in your view, that means the tiles are not provisioned for your account. Please reach out to your Success Manager if there are any questions around this.

##### For Leads over time and Contacts over time, what is the count referencing? {#faq-forleadsovertimeandcontactsovertime-whatisthecountreferencing?}

It is using the touchpoint counts, distributed by the Attribution Model you select. It will be the total Leads and Counts distributed over time. It is not a unique count.

##### Does the chart for Form URLs by Channel in Content Marketing show Web Visits or Form Fills? {#faq-doesthechartforformurlsbychannelincontentmarketingshowwebvisitsorformfills?}

These are only tracked form fills.

##### What's the benefit of Discover over Measure? {#faq-what'sthebenefitofdiscoverovermeasure?}

Bizible Discover provides better functionality, such as drill-throughs, and better filtering, such as Subchannels and Channels. We are also sunsetting Measure some time in 2019.

##### In Measure, I was able to filter by Ad Group and Account when filtered into Ad accounts - how can I see this in Discover? {#faq-inmeasure-iwasabletofilterbyadgroupandaccountwhenfilteredintoadaccounts-howcaniseethisindiscover?}

This will only be available with the Paid Media board.

##### How is the Cohort Funnel different than the Passport Funnel? {#faq-howisthecohortfunneldifferentthanthepassportfunnel?}

The Cohort funnel allows you to look at your sales funnel conversion rate, measuring the impact between stages. You can select the stage that you want to measure from using the filters, which will enable to you view the conversion rate from that stage to all subsequent stages. The Passport board shows all Leads/Contacts and Opportunities that have gone through each pipeline stage within a given time frame.

##### How is content on the Paid Media board determined? {#faq-howiscontentonthepaidmediaboarddetermined?}

On each of the board tiles, we added a filter to only include data where we have a known Ad Provider from Facebook, Google, Bing, LinkedIn, or Doubleclick since our integration allows us to pull the ad data from those sources. In addition, we added a fuzzy name matching to Channels and Subchannels for Display, Paid Search, Paid Social, PPC, SEM, Paid Mobile, Paid Twitter, Adroll, Terminus, Madison Logic, Madisonlogic, and Demandbase.

##### What’s the difference between Visits and Unique Visits? {#faq-what’sthedifferencebetweenvisitsanduniquevisits?}

Unique Visits are a subset of Visits. Whereas Visits are a count of every site visit, Unique Visits are unique cookies from those site visits. A person can account for multiple unique visits if they return with a different cookie identifier.

##### Are Touchpoint Counts the count of Bizible Touchpoints or Bizible Attribution Touchpoints? {#faq-aretouchpointcountsthecountofbizibletouchpointsorbizibleattributiontouchpoints?}

It’s a count of what we consider “raw” touchpoints, or “user touchpoints” where it’s an aggregate of both, plus touches that didn’t result in a touchpoint on the Lead/Contact or Opportunity.

##### When I filter by URL, why does the Cost Per tiles just show $0.00? {#faq-whenifilterbyurl-whydoesthecostpertilesjustshow$0.00?}

This is the expected behavior due to the fact that we don't have costs segmented by URL so it is not applicable in that scenario.

##### Why don’t all Segment options appear for my Category filters? {#faq-whydon’tallsegmentoptionsappearformycategoryfilters?}

Only the Segments that have valid records mapped to them will show up in the Segments filter. For example, if there are no records with the segment “Other,” then “Other” will not show up as an option.
