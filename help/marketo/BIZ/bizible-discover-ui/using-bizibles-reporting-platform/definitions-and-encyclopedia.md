**Marketing Ops FAQ**

Q: Why is there both an ‘Account ID’ and ‘Account Name’ filter?  
A: While account IDs are unique, account names don’t have to be. For example, you could have created multiple different accounts for each business unit within an enterprise company. While using the account name may be more intuitive, to ensure you’re filtering for a specific account, you may want to use the account ID.

Q: If I filter by Account ID, will all the tables by filtered?  
A: Yes, it will apply the filter to every tile in the board. For example, if your were to apply an account filter for ‘Microsoft,’ in the ‘Opportunities’ tile you will only see opportunities related to Microsoft.

Q: What is the ‘Engagement Rating’ column?  
A: The engagement rating pulls from Bizible’s Predictive Account Engagement Score, which is available in Bizible Tier 2. If you do not have this, this field will show up as null.

Q: Can I change how the table is sorted?  
A: Yes, if you click any of the column headers, it will sort the table. If you click the same header again, it will reverse how the table is sorted.

Q: Can I export the data?  
A: Yes, when hovering over the tile title (e.g., ‘Accounts’), click on the three vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner. This will enable you to download the data for that tile in the following formats: TXT, CSV, XLS, JSON, HTML, and Markdown.

Q: Can I see beyond 500 rows of data?  
A: The tile is limited to displaying 500 rows at a time, but you can export the data and choose ‘All Results’ to see more than the 500 rows displayed.
