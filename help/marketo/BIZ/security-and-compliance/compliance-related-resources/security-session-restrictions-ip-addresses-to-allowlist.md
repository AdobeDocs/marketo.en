Security Session Restrictions: IP Addresses to Allowlist - Bizible - Product Documentation

If there are [Session Security Settings](http://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=admin_sessions.htm&type=0) in place preventing specific IP Addresses from pushing/pulling data to your Salesforce instance, we will need the following IPs allowlisted to allow Bizible to push data to Salesforce:

##### 23.100.229.112/28  
23.100.234.220  
23.101.160.122  
23.101.165.12  
23.101.171.23  
52.162.84.192/28  
65.52.17.21  
157.55.161.105  
174.127.184.158

To add Bizible's IPs to the Trusted IP Ranges in Salesforce, click **Setup** > **Administration Setup** > **Security Controls** > **Network Access** > **New**.
