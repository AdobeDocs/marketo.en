Connecting Bizible to Unbounce Script Manager - Bizible - Product Documentation

Bizible integrates directly with Unbounce, allowing you to track the digital marketing source of your landing page conversions directly in Salesforce. To make the connection, simply add the Bizible script to your Unbounce Script Manager. Here's how.

1. Log-in to your Unbounce account.
1. Click **Settings** > **Script Manager** > **Add Script**.
1. In the popup, select Custom Script and name it "Bizible Marketing Analytics." Click **Add Script Details**.
1. Select placement in the Head. Include the script on Main Landing Page and Form Confirmation Dialog. Paste the Bizible script below into the box.

   *<script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.bizible.com/scripts/bizible.js" async=""></script>*

1. Click **Save**.

The Bizible integration works on Unbounce landing pages as long as they are hosted on your domain (e.g. landing.mysite.com) not those using the unbounce.com domain.
