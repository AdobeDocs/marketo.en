Hiding Unnecessary Report Types - Bizible - Product Documentation

It is often the case that not every single report that the Bizible package comes with will be used by your organization. Therefore, it is helpful to hide report types that you are not using in order to eliminate any confusion and allow for a cleaner appearance. You can hide any reports you'd like, but the reports identified in the image below are usually hidden.

1. Navigate&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Reports&nbsp;tab.
1. Click the&nbsp;**Create New Report** button at the top of the screen.
1. Type in the word "Touchpoint" to populate all of the reports.   

1. Select the&nbsp;**Select Report Types to Hide&nbsp;**checkbox at the top left.
1. Click on the reports marked below with an orange X to make your report list look the same as the image below.
