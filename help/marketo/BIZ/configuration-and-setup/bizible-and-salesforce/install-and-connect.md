Install and Connect - Bizible - Product Documentation

This lesson provides an overview of the Bizible components that are added to your Salesforce upon installation and how to connect your Salesforce account to your Bizible account.

#### Installation {#installation}

Two packages must be installed in order to use Bizible in your Salesforce environment:

* Bizibleâ€™s base package
* Dashboard Extension Package

To integrate with Salesforce, Bizible mirrors the way Salesforce organizes and displays data. Salesforce organizes data into Objects, Records, Fields, and allows you to visualize this data through Reports and Dashboards. When Bizible is installed into SF, we add our own Objects, Fields, Reports, and Dashboards.

Bizible's **Base Package** contains:

* 7 Custom Bizible Objects
* Custom Bizible Fields
* 25 Stock Reports

Bizible's **Dashboard Extension Package** contains three pre-built Dashboards.

Bizible is able to read standard SF Objects, Fields and Records, however Bizible will never update or push data to them. All the data collected by Bizible's Javascript will be surfaced in the Bizible Custom Objects and Fields.
