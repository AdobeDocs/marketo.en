# Overview {#overview}

Welcome to the next-gen Marketo Engage experience, a new interface that provides enhanced usability along with a new look and feel across the Marketo platform.

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>If your IT team restricts web access using an allowlist, ask them to add the following domains (including the asterisk) to allow all Marketo resources and websockets:
>
>* *.marketo.com
>* *.marketodesigner.com
>* *.mktoweb.com

## Take the Tour {#take-the-tour}

At first log-in, a pop-up will appear, ready to give you the rundown of the new experience. Heads up, if you choose to skip it, it will **not** be available later.

The tour walks you through everything you need to know!

## What's New {#whats-new}

There's a lot of new functionality in this next-gen experience, all of which is designed to significantly improve your marketing experience.

**Icons**

The new interface features improved and expanded iconography. Learn about them here: [New Icon Glossary](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-engage-next-generation-experience/new-icon-glossary.md).

**Tree**

The tree has been upgraded, too. But at this time, dragging and dropping is not available. You can still move assets, however. Learn how: [Moving Assets](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-engage-next-generation-experience/moving-assets.md).

**Global Navigation**

Goodbye superball. You now have quick access to all of the main Marketo sections.

**Instance URL**

You also have quick access to your munchkin ID, which is now reflected in your instance's URL (even more helpful to those with multiple subscriptions).

 </tbody>
</table>

>[!NOTE]
>
>Everything that used to live in the superball drop-down is still available as a tile in your My Marketo.

>[!TIP]
>
>Using the search in the tree will only yield results from the section you're in (e.g., Marketing Activities). If you'd like to search your entire instance, use the global search.

Enjoy the new Marketo Engage experience, and be sure to share your feedback!
