# Toggle Switch {#toggle-switch}

The Toggle Switch allows you to switch between Marketo's classic interface and the new next-gen Marketo Engage experience. It's available in the Landing Page List View and on Form detail pages.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When the Toggle Switch is selected, all existing workflows will be autosaved prior to the UI change occurring. If an operation is already in progress (ex: an asset is in the process of being approved), you'll receive an error message indicating as such and should try again after the operation is completed.

## Landing Page List View {#landing-page-list-view}

The next-gen Landing Page list view offers search filters and the ability to perform mass Landing Page actions.
