# Send Your In-App Message {#send-your-in-app-message}

After you've created your in-app message, it's time to send it out. Here are the steps:

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you're testing an in-app message triggered by App Open, be sure you download the app onto the phone, open it and close it. This initializes the SDK code. The next time you open the app, the in-app message will display. Custom events trigger the first time the app is opened.

1. In Marketing Activities, click the folder where you want the program to live and choose **New Program**.
