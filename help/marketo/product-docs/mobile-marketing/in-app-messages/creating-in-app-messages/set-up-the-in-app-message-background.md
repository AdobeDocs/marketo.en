# Set Up the In-App Message Background {#set-up-the-in-app-message-background}

1. In the editor, click the background area.

   >Image size is limited to 1440 x 2560 px and 5MB.

1. Evaluate the results. Oops-maybe a plain color, texture, or gradient will work better!

1. Apply an optional image border. The default setting is **[!UICONTROL Off]**. First, select the color by clicking it or entering the Hex or RGB numbers on the color picker.

1. Select a corner radius using the slider. Select a position from left to right: 0, 4, 8, 12, or 16 pixels. The 8-pixel (center) selection is the default.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >For tap actions for backgrounds, you can set up different actions for Apple and Android platforms. For example, deep links are handled differently for Apple and Android. If your message is going only to one platform or the other, leave the other one in the default setting or select **[!UICONTROL None]**.

   To finish the job, your last step is to [set up the Dismiss button](/help/marketo/product-docs/mobile-marketing/in-app-messages/creating-in-app-messages/set-up-the-dismiss-button-and-approve-the-message.md).
