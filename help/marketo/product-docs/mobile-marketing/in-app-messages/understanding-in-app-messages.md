# Understanding In-App Messages {#understanding-in-app-messages}

>[!NOTE]
>
>In-App messaging is an add-on application. Confirm with your Marketo account manager to be sure it's activated.

Use in-app messages to engage directly with your customers while they're using your app. When they open or take a custom action, you can present a promotional offer. One click takes them to a landing page, external website, or deep link, where they can learn more and make a purchase. Or, that click can simply dismiss the message.  You can also use in-app messages as reminders to your customers to, for example, complete their profile, or to inform them about new app features.

>Example 1: "Summer Sale" promo appears when opening the app.
>
>Example 2: While watching a medical video, schedule a doctor visit, and it triggers a $40 off coupon.

Before you can create and send in-app messages for your mobile app, you'll need your Marketo Admin and mobile apps developer to perform some setups.  There are three steps to the process of producing in-app messages:

## Step 1: Admin and Developer Perform Initial Setups {#step-admin-and-developer-perform-initial-setups}

The Marketo Admin and mobile apps developer work together to set you up. See [Before You Create Push Notifications and In-App Messages](/help/marketo/product-docs/mobile-marketing/admin/before-you-create-push-notifications-and-in-app-messages.md) for details.

## Step 2: Create an In-App Message {#step-create-an-in-app-message}

You [create an in-app message](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/create+an+in-app+message) using the online editor.

## Step 3: Send! {#step-send}

You create a program to [send the message](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/send+your+in-app+message).

You're on your way.
