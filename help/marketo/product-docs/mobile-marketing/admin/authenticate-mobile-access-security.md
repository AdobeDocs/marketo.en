# Authenticate Mobile Access Security {#authenticate-mobile-access-security}

To improve security for Mobile users, Marketo provides two new IDs: the Access Key and the Access Secret. These help to ensure that users logging into your app actually are who they appear to be.

To enable the IDs, you need to acquire the codes and provide them to your IT department so they can set up a secure match.
