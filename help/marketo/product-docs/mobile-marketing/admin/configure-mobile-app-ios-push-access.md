   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You will need a **Certificate** and **Password** from your mobile apps developer. The developer receives these by logging into the Apple Developer Member Center, setting up and downloading a push notification certificate for your app, and exporting the content. The developer sets the password when making the export. **IMPORTANT**: The certificate should be appropriate for the kind of environment you're using â€” Sandbox or Production. Verify this with your Marketo Admin or mobile apps developer.

1. Select your Certificate, enter your Password, and click **Save**.

Great Job! Make sure you also configure the app with Android.
