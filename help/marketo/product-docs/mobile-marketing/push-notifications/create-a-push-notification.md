# Create a Push Notification {#create-a-push-notification}

It's easy to create a push notification. However, before you begin, you must have your Marketo Admin and Mobile Apps Developer set up some things you'll need while you're doing it. See [Understanding Push Notifications](/help/marketo/product-docs/mobile-marketing/push-notifications/understanding-push-notifications.md) for details.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Marketing Activities]** area.
