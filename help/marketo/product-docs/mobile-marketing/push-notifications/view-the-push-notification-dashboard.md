   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The _Sent_ metric may reflect more sends than the exact number of people to whom the the push notification was sent. That's because it's calculated based on the *number of devices* that qualify to receive your push. For example, if a single person has three devices, the dashboard registers three sends, not one.
