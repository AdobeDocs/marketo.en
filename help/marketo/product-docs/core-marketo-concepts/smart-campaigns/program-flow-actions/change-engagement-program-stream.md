# Change Engagement Program Stream {#change-engagement-program-stream}

## Overview {#overview}

Normally you would use [stream transition rules](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing/engagement-program-streams/transition-people-between-engagement-streams.md) to achieve this, but if you want to manually move people from one stream to another, this is the flow step to use.

## Usage {#usage}

1. Select the engagement program you want to move the person to.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you select a different program, it will leave the person in their current stream as well as add them to the new.
