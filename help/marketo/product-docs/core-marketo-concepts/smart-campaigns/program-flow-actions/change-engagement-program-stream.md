# Change Engagement Program Stream {#change-engagement-program-stream}

Normally, you would use [stream transition rules](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing/engagement-program-streams/transition-people-between-engagement-streams.md) to achieve this. But if you want to manually move people from one stream to another, this is the flow step to use.

1. Select the engagement program you want to move the person to.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you select a different program, it will leave the person in their current stream as well as add them to the new.
