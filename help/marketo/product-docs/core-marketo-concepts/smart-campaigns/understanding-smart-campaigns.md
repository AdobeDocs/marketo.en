# Understanding Smart Campaigns {#understanding-smart-campaigns}

If Marketo is a powerful car, the smart campaign is truly the engine. It's simple to get started but can do almost anything you ask of it.

The smart campaign has 3 main areas: The [Smart List](../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/understanding-smart-lists.md), [Flow](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Flow+Actions) and [Schedule](using-smart-campaigns/schedule-a-recurring-batch-campaign.md) tabs.

## Smart List {#smart-list}

The smart list is how you define WHO you want to target with your smart campaign. It has filters and triggers.

<table> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <th>Type</th> 
   <th>Example</th> 
   <th>Explanation</th> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Filter</td> 
   <td>Clicked Link</td> 
   <td><p>Collect all of the people in a batch that qualify at the present time.</p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colspan="1">Trigger</td> 
   <td colspan="1">Clicks Link</td> 
   <td colspan="1">The moment someone does something, fire the flow immediately.</td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

You can combine filters in various ways as well as use them in conjunction with triggers. This is a powerful tool--experiment with it.

## Flow {#flow}

The flow includes the steps you want the smart campaign to perform, including Wait steps and split choices.

## Schedule {#schedule}

Finally, this controls when you run your smart campaign. You can even set up recurrence so it runs on a repeating schedule.

<br>&nbsp;

There is an enormous amount of things the smart campaign can do. Get the hang of it and you'll find everything in Marketo becomes much simpler to understand.
