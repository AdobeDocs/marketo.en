# Define Smart List for Smart Campaign | Trigger {#define-smart-list-for-smart-campaign-trigger}

Make a Smart Campaign run on one person at a time based on live events by adding triggers.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Making Smart List or Flow Step edits to an active campaign can potentially break its functionality. If you choose to do so, proceed with caution. 

1. In your Smart Campaign, click the **[!UICONTROL Smart List]** tab.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >A Smart Campaign with triggers runs in _Trigger_ mode. It runs on one person at a time based on events triggered and any additional filters.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >When using a Boolean field in a trigger campaign Smart List, you must explicitly set it to 'false' in order for the field to evaluate properly during execution of the campaign.

1. Click the drop-down and choose an operator.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >Red squiggly lines indicate errors or missing information. If not corrected, the campaign will be invalid and won't run.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >In a Smart Campaign with both triggers and filters, the triggers go at the top and when triggered, only people who satisfy the filter criteria go through the flow.

1. Define the trigger.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >With multiple triggers, a person goes through the flow if _ANY_ one of the triggers gets activated.
