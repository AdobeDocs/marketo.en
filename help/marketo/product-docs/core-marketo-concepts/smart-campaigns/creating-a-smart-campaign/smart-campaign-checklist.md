# Smart Campaign Checklist {#smart-campaign-checklist}

Follow the below steps to ensure smooth running of the Smart Campaign and prevent errors as much as possible.

## Get Rid of Smart List Errors {#get-rid-of-smart-list-errors}

   In your Smart Campaign, click on **Smart List**. Get rid of any red squiggly lines that you see by fixing the errors.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Red squiggly lines indicate errors or missing information. If not corrected, the campaign will be invalid and won't run.
   >
   >Also, **keep things simple**. If you have dozens or hundreds of filters, it's hard to maintain it and keep track. Fewer filters are also faster to load.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Using **Member of Smart List** could have errors in that other list. Check there too.

## Get Rid of Flow Errors {#get-rid-of-flow-errors}

In your Smart Campaign, click **Flow**. Get rid of any red squiggly lines you see by fixing the errors.
