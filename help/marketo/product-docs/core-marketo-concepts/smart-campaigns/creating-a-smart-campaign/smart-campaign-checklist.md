# Smart Campaign Checklist {#smart-campaign-checklist}

Follow the below steps to ensure smooth running of the smart campaign and prevent errors as much as possible.

1. Get Rid of Smart List Errors

   In your smart campaign, click on **Smart List**. Get rid of any red squiggly lines that you see by fixing the errors.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Red squiggly lines indicate errors or missing information. If not corrected, the campaign will be invalid and won't run.
   >
   >
   >Also, **keep things simple**. If you have dozens or hundreds of filters, it's hard to maintain it and keep track. Fewer filters are also faster to load.
