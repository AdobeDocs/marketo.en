This flow step will insert Marketo-created people as leads into your Salesforce CRM.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only available when integrated with [!DNL Salesforce].

1. By default, this flow step will assign to lead owners based on the Salesforce auto-assignment rules.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >[!DNL Salesforce] requires that the person has Company and Last Name fields filled out. Otherwise, it will reject the lead record.

1. You can set a specific [!DNL Salesforce] user or lead queue as the lead owner.

   When using this flow step, the person is synced as a [!DNL Salesforce] lead immediately and does not need to wait for the regular sync.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >[!DNL Salesforce] does not allow "Contacts" to be assigned to lead queues. In this case Marketo will create a duplicate "Lead" in [!DNL Salesforce].
