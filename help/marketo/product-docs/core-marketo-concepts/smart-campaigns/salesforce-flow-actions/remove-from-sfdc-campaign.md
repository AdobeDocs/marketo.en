Remove from SFDC Campaign - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

>[!NOTE]

>**FYI**

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

>Only available when integrated with Salesforce.

#### Overview {#overview}

Just like how you can [Add to SFDC Campaign](add-to-sfdc-campaign.md)and [Change Status in SFDC Campaign](change-status-in-sfdc-campaign.md), you can also remove people or leads from a Salesforce campaign.

   >If the person or lead is not a member of the campaign you selected, they will be skipped.

That's it! When people or leads flow through, they will be removed from the Salesforce campaign you chose.
