It's not a good idea to email someone multiple times a day or too many times in a week, right? Luckily, Marketo has communication limits to help. Here's how they work.

>When any person exceeds the set communication limits, Marketo blocks non-operational emails (operational emails always send).

##### 1. In your smart campaign, click the Schedule tab and then Edit Settings. {#in-your-smart-campaign-click-the-schedule-tab-and-then-edit-settings}

Sweet. Now you can be assured you aren't accidentally sending too many emails to your audience.
