# Move a Smart Campaign {#move-a-smart-campaign}

Move a smart campaign between different programs or folders by using drag-and-drop or the move feature in the tree. The rules of your smart campaign will not change, it will just be nested in a different place.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Because the rules will not change, if the campaignâ€™s Smart List or Flow Steps reference the original program, you must manually update that information to reflect its new program, as it will **not** auto-update.

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing Activities]**.

   >In this example we're moving the Smart Campaign to another program, but you can also move it to a campaign folder.

Well done! The Smart Campaign has been moved.
