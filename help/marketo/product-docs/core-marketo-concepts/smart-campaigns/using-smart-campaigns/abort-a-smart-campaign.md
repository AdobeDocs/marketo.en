Sometimes you launch a smart campaign and immediately realize it was a mistake. Here's how to pull the emergency brake and stop the smart campaign mid-run.

1. Under **Marketing Activities**, select your smart campaign and go to the **Schedule** tab.

   >Aborting does not undo steps already finished, it just stops more from happening. (Example: Emails can't be undelivered.)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Take a look at the **Results** tab of the smart campaign to see what actions took place before the abort. You will also find a&nbsp; [notification](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/miscellaneous/understanding-notifications.md) with additional details.

   >[!TIP]

   >Want to remove a person from the flow in a trigger campaign? Check out [Remove from Flow](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/flow-actions/remove-from-flow.md).

Always double-check your work, but this emergency brake may come in handy in the future.
