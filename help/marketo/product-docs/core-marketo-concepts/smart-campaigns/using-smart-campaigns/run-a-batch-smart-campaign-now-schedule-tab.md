# Run a Batch Smart Campaign Now | Schedule Tab {#run-a-batch-smart-campaign-now-schedule-tab}

Once you are done building your batch campaign, you can choose to run it now or later. Here's how to run it immediately.

1. Select the batch smart campaign, go to the **[!UICONTROL Schedule]** tab and click **[!UICONTROL Run Once]**.
