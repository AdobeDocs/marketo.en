1. Under the **[!UICONTROL Flow]** tab of the Smart Campaign, add any flow step and then click on **[!UICONTROL Add Choice]**.

   >[!TIP]

   >You can set any of your flow steps to --Do Nothing--, in which case no action will be taken on that choice.

   >Only the first matching choice is applied to the flow step. Learn how to [reorder "Add Choice" in a flow action](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/flow-actions/reorder-add-choice-in-a-flow-step.md){target="_blank"}.

   Great! You can now create a single Smart Campaign with flow step choices instead of creating multiple Smart Campaigns for each choice.
