# Remove from Flow {#remove-from-flow}

Imagine you have a Smart Campaign flow that uses "Send Alert" to remind a sales rep to call a hot prospect. It sends one message every day until the rep makes the call. You could use "Remove from Flow" in a trigger campaign once the prospect has been contacted to stop further alerts. It's like a Smart Campaign ejector seat for a person.
