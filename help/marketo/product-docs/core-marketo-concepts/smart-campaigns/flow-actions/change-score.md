   Changes:

    * **+5** to increment 
    * **-5** will decrement (negative numbers allowed)
    * **=5** will make the score that exact number
    * **=-5** will make the score that exact negative number

   Get some basic scoring in place quickly and then tweak the results over time. That's what we did!
