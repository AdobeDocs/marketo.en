# View Blocked People in a Smart Campaign {#view-blocked-people-in-a-smart-campaign}

Blocked people in the Marketo database are marked blocklisted, unsubscribed, marketing suspended, and/or have an invalid or empty email.

>[!NOTE]

>Marketo is in the process of changing terms such as Blacklist and Whitelist to Blocklist and Allowlist in our product. During this update, you may see the old terms in our UI and documentation screenshots, and the new terms in our documentation text. We apologize for any confusion.

1. In your smart campaign, click on **Schedule**. Under **Smart List Status** click on the second link.
