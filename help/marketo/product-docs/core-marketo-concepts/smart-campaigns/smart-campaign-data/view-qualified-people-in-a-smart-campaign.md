   >The Qualified People list does not account for people who are blocked or have reached their communication limits.

   >[!NOTE]

   >The number of qualified people also depends on the smart campaign qualification rules. Learn how to [edit qualification rules](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/using-smart-campaigns/edit-qualification-rules-in-a-smart-campaign.md).

Sweet! You can use this list to check which people might go through the flow before you run a smart campaign.
