## Visualizing a Nested Execute Campaign {#visualizing-a-nested-execute-campaign}

Execute campaigns run in series with the parent campaign. People that qualify for an executable campaign complete all Flow Steps from the campaign and return to the primary campaign to continue through the Flow Steps of this campaign.

Below is an example of a Smart Campaign, "Campaign A," which includes an execute campaign Flow Step. Think of "Campaign A" as your primary campaign.

   ![](assets/engagement-map-tab-11.png)

1. Clicking on the execute campaign flow card will expand to show details of "Campaign B".
1. "Campaign B" includes a filter that splits the audience into two groups: qualified and not qualified.
1. Qualified audience goes through the Flow Steps associated to "Campaign B."
1. All audience (qualified and not qualified) return to "Campaign A" and move on to the next Flow Step.

You can click on the Execute Campaign Flow Step in "Campaign B" which will expand to show the choice cards and campaign associated with each choice.

## Visualizing Request Campaign {#visualizing-request-campaign}

Request campaigns run in parallel with the parent campaign. People that qualify for a request campaign complete all the Flow Steps from the campaign and then exit the campaign. Concurrently, the same set of people go through the Flow Steps from the primary campaign.

Here's an example of a Smart Campaign, "Campaign A," which includes a request campaign Flow Step. Think of "Campaign A" as your primary campaign.

   ![](assets/engagement-map-tab-14.png)

1. Clicking on the request campaign flow card will expand to show the details of "Campaign B"
1. "Campaign B" includes a filter that splits the audience into two groups: qualified and not qualified.
1. Qualified audience goes through the Flow Steps associated to "Campaign B."
1. At the same time, all audience moves to the next Flow Steps in "Campaign A."

You can dive deeper into your nested campaigns if any of the Flow Steps include another request campaign by clicking on the flow card to view the details of the campaign.

## Error Handling {#error-handling}

Errors in Smart Lists and Flow Steps will be highlighted via a red icon in the card. Additionally, a corresponding error message will be reflected in the slide-out panel.

Warnings in Smart Lists and Flow Steps will be highlighted via an orange icon in the card. Additionally, a corresponding warning message will be reflected in the slide-out panel.

Below is an example of a warning in a Choice card which shows in the Execute Campaign flow step card, slide-out panel, and the Default choice card.

**Errors in filter cards can include:**

* An error in the Smart List which will result in qualified audience not being shown

* An error in the filter logic
