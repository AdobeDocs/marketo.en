## Things to Note {#things-to-note}

   Marketo currently supports Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.4 and 6.5.

   All users in your instance will be able to view/access the images you import.

   Images are not automatically updated. If an image you imported into the Marketo Design Studio is updated in AEM, you must manually re-import it into Marketo.
