* **GDPR** [General Data Protection Regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-does-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-govern_en) is the European Union’s (EU) privacy law that harmonizes and modernizes data protection requirements for EU countries.
* **CCPA** [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=3.&title=1.81.5.&part=4.&chapter=&article=) provides California residents rights in regards to their personal information and imposes data protection responsibilities on certain entities that conduct business in California.
* **PDPA** [Personal Data Protection Act](https://secureprivacy.ai/thailand-pdpa-summary-what-businesses-need-to-know/) is the privacy law that harmonizes and modernizes data protection requirements for Thailand.
* **LGPD** [Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/Brazilian_General_Data_Protection_Law.pdf) effective as of early 2021 for all companies collecting or processing personal data in Brazil.
* **NZPA** [Privacy Act 2020](https://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-act-2020/privacy-act-2020/) is the privacy law that harmonizes and modernizes data protection requirements for New Zealand.

## Right to Access and Right to be Forgotten {#right-to-access-and-right-to-be-forgotten}

In order to help you facilitate your Privacy readiness, Marketo Engage allows you to handle **access** and **delete** requests.

* The **Right to Access** is the right for the Data Subject to obtain from the Data Controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose. The Data Controller shall provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge, in an electronic format.
* Also known as Data Erasure, the **Right to be Forgotten** (delete request) entitles the Data Subject to have the Data Controller erase his/her personal data, cease further dissemination of the data, and potentially have third parties halt processing of the data.

To learn how you can create access/delete requests and how we process them, refer to [this article](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/miscellaneous/privacy-requests.md).
