# Set Up Adobe Experience Cloud Audience Sharing {#set-up-adobe-experience-cloud-audience-sharing}

   >For security reasons, you must be an Org Admin for the Adobe Organization that you want to map to. If you're not, the action will fail.

1. If you're *not* already logged in, a pop-up will appear in a new tab/window. Log-in to your Adobe org (this action validates the org access).

   And that's it! You can now begin [sharing audience data](http://docs.marketo.com/x/ogI6Ag).
