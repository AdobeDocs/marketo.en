   Adios folder!

#### Archive a Folder {#archive-a-folder}

In Marketo you have the ability to convert existing folders into Archive folders. Archive folders exist in Marketing Activities, Database, and Design Studio.

When you archive a folder:

* The folder and assets are no longer visible in search results. If you search for a Program or Event that’s inside an archived folder, the results return a collapsed view of the archived folder
* The assets in the folder no longer appear in auto suggest
* Archived templates are not available when creating an email or landing page in Design Studio
* Archived pages can’t be used in landing page test groups

Functionality that will **not** change when archiving:

* Global search still finds results in archived folders
* An asset that’s in use will continue to work even after it’s archived
* You can use a filter to select archived assets for use in reports
* Archived assets are not deactivated. They must also be deactivated if you want them to stop running
