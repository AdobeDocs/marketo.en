# Marketo Sandbox {#marketo-sandbox}

A Marketo sandbox is an additional instance used for testing purposes before implementation in the production environment.

>Not all customers have purchased this feature. Please contact your Customer Success Manager for details.

A Marketo sandbox cannot be synced to your regular CRM if it's already synced to your production instance. Use your CRM's sandbox for the sync, and follow [all the same steps](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/CRM+Sync) as the original sync.  

#### Things to Know About Sandboxes  
{#things-to-know-about-sandboxes}

##### Once your Customer Success Manager has your sandbox set up and sends you the invite, you must use a different email address to log-in than your Marketo production instance. {#once-your-customer-success-manager-has-your-sandbox-set-up-and-sends-you-the-invite-you-must-use-a-different-email-address-to-log-in-than-your-marketo-production-instance}

##### If you wish to add users, the process is the same as [adding users in production](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Managing+Marketo+Users#ManagingMarketoUsers-CreateUsers). Again, they must use a different email address if they already have a Marketo log-in. {#if-you-wish-to-add-users-the-process-is-the-same-as-adding-users-in-production-again-they-must-use-a-different-email-address-if-they-already-have-a-marketo-log-in}

##### Your Marketo sandbox will start out empty, but have the same features available as your production instance. {#your-marketo-sandbox-will-start-out-empty-but-have-the-same-features-available-as-your-production-instance}

##### You can submit a Support case requesting a one-time instance copy to fill your sandbox. The instance copy will not bring over *everything*, however. Please consult Marketo Support for details. {#you-can-submit-a-support-case-requesting-a-one-time-instance-copy-to-fill-your-sandbox-the-instance-copy-will-not-bring-over-everything-however-please-consult-marketo-support-for-details}

##### If you create a program in your sandbox and want to move it to production, you can perform a [program import](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Import+a+Program). {#if-you-create-a-program-in-your-sandbox-and-want-to-move-it-to-production-you-can-perform-a-program-import}

##### Sandboxes are throttled so production instances aren't adversely affected by testing environments. You can send up to 30 emails per campaign run.
