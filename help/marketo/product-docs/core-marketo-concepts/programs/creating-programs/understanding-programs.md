# Understanding Programs {#understanding-programs}

Programs represent a single marketing initiative. You can think of it as a container with all the stuff that you need to make the program work - these are called local assets and include** [landing pages](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/landing+pages)**, ** [email](../../../../product-docs/email-marketing.md)**, ** [smart campaigns](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/smart+campaigns)**, and more. Programs do a lot, but it's easy to get started.

There are four types of programs:

**Event Programs**

** [Events](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/events)** have a specific time and date. They help you coordinate, facilitate, and track your live and online events.

**Engagement Programs**

** [Drip Nurturing](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/drip+nurturing)** is used to nurture people at a set periodic schedule.

**Email Programs**

The ** [classic mail blast](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Email+Programs)**. It has cool built-in features like A/B testing and [Email Head Start](../../../../product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/head-start-for-email-programs.md).

**Default Programs**

A default program is anything that is not an event, engagement, or email program. Get creative.

Let's get started!
