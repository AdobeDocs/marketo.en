# Understanding Programs {#understanding-programs}

Programs represent a single marketing initiative. You can think of it as a container with all the stuff that you need to make the program work - these are called local assets and include **Landing Pages**, **email**, **Smart Campaigns**, and more. Programs do a lot, but it's easy to get started.

There are four types of programs:

## Event Programs {#event-programs}

**[Events](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/events/understanding-events/understanding-event-programs.md){target="_blank"}** have a specific time and date. They help you coordinate, facilitate, and track your live and online events.

## Engagement Programs {#engagement-programs}

**[Drip Nurturing](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing/creating-an-engagement-program/understanding-engagement-programs.md){target="_blank"}** is used to nurture people at a set periodic schedule.

## Email Programs {#email-programs}

The **[classic mail blast](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/creating-an-email-program/understanding-email-programs.md){target="_blank"}**. It has cool built-in features like A/B testing and **[Email Head Start](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/head-start-for-email-programs.md){target="_blank"}**.

## Default Programs {#default-programs}

A default program is anything that is not an event, engagement, or email program. Get creative.

Let's get started!
