# Program Member Custom Field Tokens {#program-member-custom-field-tokens}

## Token Support for Program Member Custom Fields {#token-support-for-program-member-custom-fields}

On the back of Program Member Custom Fields features, support is being extended for Program Member Custom Fields in token frameworks.

The PMCF tokens will be supported under the member domain of the tokens family.

Member Tokens are used for fields under the scope of Program Member. As of current state, Member Tokens are also used to insert unique values from integrated services partners. `{{member.webinar url}}` token automatically resolves the person's unique confirmation URL generated by the service provider. {{member.registration code}} resolves to the registration code provided by the service provider.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Program Member Custom Fields can be used only in the context of a program.
>* Program Member Custom Fields Tokens cannot be used in: email preheader, Date Tokens in Wait Steps, or Snippets.
>* Program Member Status is not supported in Member Tokens.
