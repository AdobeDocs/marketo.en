   Besides the detailed dashboard, an advantage to using an [email program](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/creating-an-email-program/understanding-email-programs.md){target="_blank"} instead of a smart campaign is the ability to easily implement an [A/B test](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/add-an-a-b-test.md){target="_blank"}. Enjoy!
