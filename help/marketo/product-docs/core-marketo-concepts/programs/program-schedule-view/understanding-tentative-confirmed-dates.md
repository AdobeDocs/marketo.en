# Understanding Tentative/Confirmed Dates {#understanding-tentative-confirmed-dates}

Smart campaigns and email programs have a powerful capability to be marked as **[!UICONTROL Tentative]** or **[!UICONTROL Confirmed]**. Here's how they work.

## Tentative {#tentative}

Tentative dates convey intent. Think of this as _penciling_ something in the calendar. Tentative entries will not run - they are placeholders only.

## Confirming Entries {#confirming-entries}

This is just like approving an asset, so entries need to been fully set up before you can confirm them. Once all your ducks are in a row, you can confirm entries by sliding the [!UICONTROL Tentative] tab to the right.

## Confirmed {#confirmed}

Confirmed entries will definitely run. They have rules, approved assets, and a confirmed date and time.

## Finished  {#finished}

Finished entries have already run. They can only be in the past (obviously). Once an entry has run and is **[!UICONTROL Finished]**, you cannot move it or make it tentative. (No changing reality and disrupting the time-stream continuum.)

These states are powerful tools. When you clone a program, all of the smart campaign and email program dates will be tentative. They can all be confirmed right from the schedule view. Cool, right?
