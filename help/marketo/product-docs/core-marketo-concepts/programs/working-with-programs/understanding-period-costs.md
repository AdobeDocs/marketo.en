## How Period Costs are Calculated {#how-period-costs-are-calculated}

Imagine an event, like a webinar, that occurs in March. New people are acquired beforehand from advertising in January and February. New contacts are also acquired after the event, when people download the webinar in the months of April and May.

1. With a single period cost attributed to March...

   ...contacts added in the months before and after will _only_ count towards March.

   >[!NOTE]

   >In summary - months with no defined period costs will roll "backwards" to the last one that was defined. If there is no prior period cost, the months will be rolled "forward" to the next one that has been defined. If a period cost has not been defined for _any_ months, reporting in RCE will not be available for the program.
