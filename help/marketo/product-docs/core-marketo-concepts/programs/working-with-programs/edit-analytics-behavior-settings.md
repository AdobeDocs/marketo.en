# Edit Analytics Behavior Settings {#edit-analytics-behavior-settings}

You can set the [analytics behavior at the admin level on channels](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics/program-analytics/make-a-program-without-a-period-cost-available-in-revenue-explorer-and-analyzers.md){target="_blank"}, but you can also edit it at the program level. Here's how.

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing Activities]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Definition**
>
>**[!UICONTROL Inclusive]** - This option will ensure that the program is available for reporting in revenue explorer and analyzers regardless of whether or not you've included a period cost.
>
>**[!UICONTROL Operational]** - This option results in the program not showing up in either revenue explorer or analyzers.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The default behavior (if this setting is not applied) is the program would be included in Analytics ONLY if there is at least one period cost, even one with zero dollars assigned.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

Nicely done! Now you know how to override the analytics behavior at the program level.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The changes will take effect the next day and the program will either be made available or pulled out of revenue explorer and analyzers.
