# Use Members of List in a Smart List {#use-members-of-list-in-a-smart-list}

>[!TIP]
>
>You can add people to a list using [Import](/help/marketo/getting-started/quick-wins/import-a-list-of-people.md) or the [Add to List flow step](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/flow-actions/add-to-list.md).

With this filter, you can pull members from another list by referring to it in your smart list rules. Here's how.

1. Select a smart list and click the **[!UICONTROL Smart List]** tab.

   Done! In this example, the smart list will now target only members of that list and evaluate them based on any other rules you include.
