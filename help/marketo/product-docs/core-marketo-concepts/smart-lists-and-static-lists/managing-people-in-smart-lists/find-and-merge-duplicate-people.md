# Find and Merge Duplicate People {#find-and-merge-duplicate-people}

Marketo Engage automatically de-duplicates when new people enter the system. However, your CRM may have initially sent over duplicates. Here's how to merge them.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Merging people is permanent, there is no "undo" option.

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>Finding and merging duplicates will involve the use of [built-in/system Smart Lists](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/using-smart-lists/use-built-in-system-smart-lists.md){target="_blank"}.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Marketo will not automatically de-dupe against a [!DNL Salesforce] or [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] sync, or when you manually enter people.

## Find Duplicates {#find-duplicates}

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Database]** area.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >Merging people in Marketo may not work if you use a [!DNL Salesforce] Person Account. Please merge the records in [!DNL Salesforce] if possible.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Possible Duplicates]** System Smart List and click on the **[!UICONTROL People]** tab.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can also [Find Duplicate People with Custom Logic](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/managing-people-in-smart-lists/find-duplicate-people-with-custom-logic.md){target="_blank"}.

## Merge People Manually {#merge-people-manually}

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >When merging people, if the losing person has a Marketo custom object, it will _not_ get re-associated to the winning person. Please re-parent the custom object prior to performing the merge.

1. Select the duplicates by holding Ctrl/Cmd and clicking, then click **[!UICONTROL Merge People]**.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You could have two or more duplicates for the same person - select them all at once.

1. You will see the values between the records that _don't_ match. Select the value you want to keep for each field. Click **[!UICONTROL Merge]** when done. If you don't want either value, you can check **[!UICONTROL Custom]** and enter a value of your choice.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When manually merging people, the first person selected will be the "winner." So in the People tab if you are merging record IDs 198 and 199, and you happen to click on 199 first, 199 will be the record ID of the merged people. This also applies if more than two records are merged.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Merging is better than deleting. You'll conserve all history (page visits, link clicks, email opens, form fills, etc.).

## Effect in Salesforce {#effect-in-salesforce}

If you have Salesforce integration, there are a few notes about the effect of merging Leads in Salesforce.

* When merging only Leads or only Contacts, they merge per normal [!DNL Salesforce] rules.
* When merging Leads and Contacts together, all Leads are converted to Contacts prior to merging per normal [!DNL Salesforce] rules.

For specifics of Salesforce behavior when merging Leads or Contacts, please check the following [!DNL Salesforce] documents:

* [Merging Duplicate Leads](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=leads_merge.htm&language=en_US){target="_blank"}
* [Merging Duplicate Contacts](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=contacts_merge.htm&language=en_US){target="_blank"}

## Bulk Merging {#bulk-merging}

If you have too many duplicates to manually merge, contact the Adobe Account Team (your Account Manager) to discuss your options.
