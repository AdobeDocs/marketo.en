   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you choose **[!UICONTROL All Columns]**, the export will be larger in size and take longer to generate/download.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >If your person records contain foreign characters that aren't rendering properly upon export, try changing the file type in the **[!UICONTROL Format]** drop-down.

1. The export will run. Once finished you can click **[!UICONTROL Download now]** to grab the file.
