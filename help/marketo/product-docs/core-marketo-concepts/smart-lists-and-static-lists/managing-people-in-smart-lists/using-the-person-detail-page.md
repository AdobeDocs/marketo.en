# Using the Person Detail Page {#using-the-person-detail-page}

The person detail page contains all the information Marketo knows about a person. You can edit data directly from this page.

## Getting to Person Detail Page {#getting-to-person-detail-page}

There are lots of ways to open specific people. Some examples are:

* From the **Database**, you can search in the Quick Find
* Any **Smart List** or list
* **Members** tab of a program
* **View Campaign Members** in a Smart Campaign
* Some **reports**
<br>&nbsp;

1. Either double-click on any person or single-click the ID on the left.
