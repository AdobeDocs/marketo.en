# Using the Person Detail Page {#using-the-person-detail-page}

The person detail page contains all the information Marketo knows about a person. You can edit data directly from this page.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

#### Getting to Person Detail Page {#getting-to-person-detail-page}
