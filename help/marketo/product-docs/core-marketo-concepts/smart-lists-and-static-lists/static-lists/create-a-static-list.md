   You now have an empty list ready to be filled. Learn how to add people [here](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/static-lists/understanding-static-lists.md#ways-to-add-remove-people-from-a-list){target="_blank"}.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can add a person to your list as many times as you like, but they'll only appear once. People remain in the list until you remove them.
