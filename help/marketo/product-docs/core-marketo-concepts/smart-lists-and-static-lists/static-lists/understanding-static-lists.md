# Understanding Static Lists {#understanding-static-lists}

Static lists are one of the most simple and useful features of Marketo. They are simply a list of names from your Database. You will find plenty of reasons to use them.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A single person in the database can be in many different static lists.

The difference between a Static and Smart List is crucial to understand.

| Type |Logic |
|---|---|
| Smart List |Based on **defined rules** |
| Static List |Based on **adding/removing each person** |

>[!CAUTION]
>
>One of the most common mistakes is thinking you can remove a person from a list by simply "deleting the person." **This is wrong**. Deleting the person will delete them from **the entire database**, not just the list.

## Some Uses of a Static List {#some-uses-of-a-static-list}

* A list that has been pre-selected to receive a marketing message.
* A "competitors" list that you use to send mischievous counter-intelligence messages.
* A temporary list of people in a particular state, who are then removed by Smart Campaigns when they exit that state.

Enjoy the power of the LIST!
