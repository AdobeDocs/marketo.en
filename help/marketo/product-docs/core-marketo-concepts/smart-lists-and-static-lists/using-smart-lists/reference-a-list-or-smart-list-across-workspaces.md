# Reference a List or Smart List Across Workspaces {#reference-a-list-or-smart-list-across-workspaces}

Lists and Smart Lists can be shared and referenced across workspaces for easy reuse from the Database.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Person partition rules apply (Smart Lists and static lists in a workspace only show people who are both members of the list _and_ members of the current workspace).
