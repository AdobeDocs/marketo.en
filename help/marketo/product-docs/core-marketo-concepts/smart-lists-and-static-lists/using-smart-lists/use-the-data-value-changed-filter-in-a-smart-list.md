# Use the Data Value Changed Filter in a Smart List {#use-the-data-value-changed-filter-in-a-smart-list}

Values are constantly changing and being updated in your Marketo database. Sometimes instead of looking for a specific value, you want to look for people that have had a change in value. Here's how.

This filter will look for all people that had a change (any change) to their Status. If you want to get even fancier, try [adding a constraint to a Smart List filter](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/using-smart-lists/add-a-constraint-to-a-smart-list-filter.md){target="_blank"}.
