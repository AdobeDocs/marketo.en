# Refresh a List or Smart List {#refresh-a-list-or-smart-list}

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

If you've run a smart list and a few minutes have passed, the results could be different now - refresh to find out.

## Refresh Results {#refresh-results}

1. To update data in the **People** tab of a smart list, click the refresh icon.

1. The smart list reruns and show you a more up-to-date result set.

>[!TIP]
>
>Sometimes when you run a smart list and come back to it later, you might see the word "About" in front of the person count in the bottom right-hand corner. This indicates that the number is approximate - click the count itself to refresh it and obtain an updated, accurate count.
