   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The filters in System Smart Lists do not need to be applied to each Smart List/Campaign. Their contents are automatically recognized.

Here's a summary of what the built-in Smart Lists do:

<table><thead>
  <tr>
    <th>List Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>All People</td>
    <td>All people in your Marketo database</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unsubscribed People</td>
    <td>These people can only be sent operational emails; this is usually controlled by the person themselves.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Marketing Suspended</td>
    <td>These people can only be sent operational emails; this is usually controlled by you, the marketer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blocklist</td>
    <td>These people will not receive any email at all.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bounced Email Addresses</td>
    <td>People with an undeliverable email address or that reject your email.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Possible Duplicates</td>
    <td>People that might be duplicated in the Marketo database.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
