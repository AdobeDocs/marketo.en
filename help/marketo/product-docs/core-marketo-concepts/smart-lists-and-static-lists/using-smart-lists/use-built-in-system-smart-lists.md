   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The filters in System Smart Lists do not need to be applied to each Smart List/Campaign. Their contents are automatically recognized.

Here's a summary of what the built-in Smart Lists do:

   | List Name |Description |
   |---|---|
   | All People |All people in your Marketo database |
   | Unsubscribed People |These people can only be sent operational emails; this is usually controlled by the person themselves. |
   | Marketing Suspended |These people can only be sent operational emails; this is usually controlled by you, the marketer. |
   | Blocklist |These people will not receive any email at all. |
   | Bounced Email Addresses |People with an undeliverable email address or that reject your email. |
   | Possible Duplicates |People that might be duplicated in the Marketo database. |

>[!NOTE]
>
>System Smart Lists can't be deleted. With the exception of the Possible Duplicates list, they cannot be edited, either.
