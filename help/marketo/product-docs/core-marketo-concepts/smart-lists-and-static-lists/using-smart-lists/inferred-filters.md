# Inferred Filters {#inferred-filters}

When someone visits your website, [Munchkin](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/additional-integrations/add-munchkin-tracking-code-to-your-website.md) cookies them and puts them into the system. We look up their IP in a special database and infer all kinds of good info. Check it out.

When you use any of these filters in a smart list, the results will yield people with this inferred information.

>[!TIP]
>
>Use these filters in a web activity report. Use the territories of the sales reps and subscribe them to a custom daily report with website visitors in the last 24 hours. They will love it!

These anonymous visitors are automatically converted into people when they click on an email link or fill out a form. However, they keep all of the inferred information.
