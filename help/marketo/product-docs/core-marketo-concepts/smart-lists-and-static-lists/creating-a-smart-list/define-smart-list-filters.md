Now that you've [created a smart list](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/creating-a-smart-list/create-a-smart-list.md) and [added filters](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/creating-a-smart-list/find-and-add-filters-to-a-smart-list.md) to it, let's define the filters. Here's how.

Continuing our example, let's define these filters to find all people in California with a score over 50.

1. Go to **Marketing Activities**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You may be storing both **California** and **CA**. In order to filter for both values and include _all_ people from California, learn how to  [add multiple values to a smart list filter](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/using-smart-lists/add-multiple-values-to-a-smart-list-filter.md).

1. Pick the **greater than** operator and enter **50**.
