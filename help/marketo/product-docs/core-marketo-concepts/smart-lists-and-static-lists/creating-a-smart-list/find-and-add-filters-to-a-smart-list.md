# Find and Add Filters to a Smart List {#find-and-add-filters-to-a-smart-list}

Once you've [created a smart list](create-a-smart-list.md), you need to add and [define](define-smart-list-filters.md) filters. Here's how to find and add filters.

In this example, let's find all people in California with a score over 50.

>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

>[!TIP]

>Explore the tree on the right - filters are very powerful and have a wide variety of possible functions.

1. Go to **Marketing Activities**.
