Create a Smart List Goal - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Goals are ways to track progress and motivate your team. They can be combined with smart lists to track all sorts of things in Marketo. Plus, after you've set up a smart list goal, it'll automatically update every 2 hours when it's used in a presentation.

Like presentations, goals are [workspace](../../../../product-docs/administration/workspaces-and-person-partitions/understanding-workspaces-and-person-partitions.md)-specific.

1. Go to the **Calendar**.
