# Delete Entries Directly In the Marketing Calendar {#delete-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar}

In addition to  [creating](create-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar.md) and  [editing](edit-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar.md) entries, you can delete them directly in the Marketing Calendar. Here's how.

1. Go to the **Calendar**.

Depending on the entry, you may have to confirm the deletion. But that's it! Easy peasy.
