# Understand/Enable Program Focus {#understand-enable-program-focus}

The Marketing Calendar gives you a bird's-eye view of things, but it also allows some interactions. You can [create](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/marketing-calendar/working-with-the-calendar/create-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar.md), [edit](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/marketing-calendar/working-with-the-calendar/edit-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar.md), [delete](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/marketing-calendar/working-with-the-calendar/delete-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar.md), and [confirm](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/marketing-calendar/working-with-the-calendar/confirm-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar.md) entries. In order to interact with entries, you must focus on a program first.

1. Go to the **Marketing Calendar**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Focusing on a program allows you to interact only with entries that belong to it and create new entries that will be housed by it.

1. Once you're done, release focus to interact with other programs/entries.

Awesome! Now go ahead and learn to interact with entries.
