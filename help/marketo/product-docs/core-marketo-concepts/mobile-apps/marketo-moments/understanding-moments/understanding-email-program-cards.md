# Understanding Email Program Cards {#understanding-email-program-cards}

Use Marketo Moments to view your Email Programs from your phone or iPad.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>On October 2, 2023, Adobe removed the Marketo Moments App from all App Stores. If you already have the app installed on your tablet/mobile device, you can continue using it for the time being. Once your Marketo Engage instance is migrated to Adobe Identity for authentication of Marketo, you will no longer be able to access the app. [Learn more](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-discussions/marketo-events-app-and-marketo-moments-app-end-of-life/m-p/340712/highlight/true#M193869){target="_blank"}.

## Email Program Cards {#email-program-cards}

When you tap any Email Program card you can:

* [Make an email a favorite](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/creating-a-favorite.md)
* [Mark an email as done](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/marking-it-done.md)
* [Share an email moment card](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/sharing-a-moment.md)

On an email program card for an email that's not sent yet, you'll find information about that email program's status and audience.

After the email has been sent, the card displays other valuable information, including the number of delivered emails, the recipients' actions, and a link to the smart list used in the campaign.
