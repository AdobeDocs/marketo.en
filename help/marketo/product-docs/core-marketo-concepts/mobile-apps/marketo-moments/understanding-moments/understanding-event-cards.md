# Understanding Event Cards {#understanding-event-cards}

Use Marketo Moments to view your event programs on your phone or iPad.

When you tap any Email Program card you can:

* [Make an event a favorite](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/creating-a-favorite.md)
* [Mark an event as done](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/marking-it-done.md)
* [Share an event moment card](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/sharing-a-moment.md)

There are two event cards. The On-Deck card, sent a few hours before the event, shows how many people are signed up. The Results card, sent afterwards, displays how many actually attended.
