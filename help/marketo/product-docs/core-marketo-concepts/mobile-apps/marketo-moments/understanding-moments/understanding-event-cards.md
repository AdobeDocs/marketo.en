* [Make an event a favorite](../../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/creating-a-favorite.md)
* [Mark an event as done](../../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/marking-it-done.md)
* [Share an event moment card](../../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/sharing-a-moment.md)

There are two event cards. The On-Deck card, sent a few hours before the event, shows how many people are signed up. The Results card, sent afterwards, displays how many actually attended.
