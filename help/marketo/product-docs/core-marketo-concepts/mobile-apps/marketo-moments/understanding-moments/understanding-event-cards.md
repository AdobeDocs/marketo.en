# Understanding Event Cards {#understanding-event-cards}

Use Marketo Moments to view your event programs on your phone or iPad.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>On October 2, 2023, Adobe removed the Marketo Moments App from all App Stores. If you already have the app installed on your tablet/mobile device, you can continue using it for the time being. Once your Marketo Engage instance is migrated to Adobe Identity for authentication of Marketo, you will no longer be able to access the app. [Learn more](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-discussions/marketo-events-app-and-marketo-moments-app-end-of-life/m-p/340712/highlight/true#M193869){target="_blank"}.

When you tap any Email Program card you can:

* [Make an event a favorite](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/creating-a-favorite.md)
* [Mark an event as done](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/marking-it-done.md)
* [Share an event moment card](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/sharing-a-moment.md)

There are two event cards. The [!UICONTROL On-Deck] card, sent a few hours before the event, shows how many people are signed up. The [!UICONTROL Results] card, sent afterwards, displays how many actually attended.
