# Understanding Marketo Moments {#understanding-marketo-moments}

The power of Marketo is now in your hands, literally! Preview and reschedule emails right from your phone or iPad.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>On October 2, 2023, Adobe removed the Marketo Moments App from all App Stores. If you already have the app installed on your tablet/mobile device, you can continue using it for the time being. Once your Marketo Engage instance is migrated to Adobe Identity for authentication of Marketo, you will no longer be able to access the app. [Learn more](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-discussions/marketo-events-app-and-marketo-moments-app-end-of-life/m-p/340712/highlight/true#M193869){target="_blank"}.

>[!NOTE]

>**Definition**
>
>* [!UICONTROL Moments]: Anything that just ran, or is about to run goes here.
>* [!UICONTROL Favorites]: Anything you make a favorite goes in here.
>* [!UICONTROL Later]: Anything taking place later than this moment goes in here.
>* [!UICONTROL Done]: Anything that finished running or you marked as done goes here.

OK, now that we've got that out of the way, let's take a peek at Marketo Moments on a phone!

## Three Kinds of Cards {#three-kinds-of-cards}

Marketo Moments gives you three different cards to follow the progress of your email:

**[!UICONTROL On-Deck]** - This email is about to go out. It's your last chance to preview it, send a sample or, even cancel it if you have to.

**[!UICONTROL Heart-beat]** - Hey - this email is being delivered now! And here are stats, too. Go ahead and share it.

**[!UICONTROL Results]** - Here's how the email did. After the email finishes running, the Results card displays the engagement score and other stats.

## Moments Stream {#moments-stream}

When you first open the app or tap **[!UICONTROL Moments]** in the menu, relevant cards show first. Each one contains information about that specific marketing initiative and its overall performance.

Tapping the card opens a detail screen.

>[!NOTE]

>Orange cards are confirmed; gray ones are tentative.

Tapping the three dots opens a card action menu.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Definition**
>
>* [!UICONTROL Favorite]: It's easy to pay attention to the stuff that's most timely and important if you make them favorites.
>* [!UICONTROL Done]: Done gets it off your Marketo Moments view (but leaves it in Marketo, safe and sound).
>* [!UICONTROL Share]: Send an image to motivate or congratulate your team.
>* [!UICONTROL Send Sample] (email only): Use this to let others check out how your emails look before you send them out.
>* [!UICONTROL Preview Email] (emails only): It's always a good idea to check out your emails in advance.
