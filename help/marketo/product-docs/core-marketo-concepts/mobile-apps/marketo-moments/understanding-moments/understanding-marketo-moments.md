## Three Kinds of Cards {#three-kinds-of-cards}

Marketo Moments gives you three different cards to follow the progress of your email:

**On-Deck** - This email is about to go out. It's your last chance to preview it, send a sample or, even cancel it if you have to.

**heart-beat** - Hey - this email is being delivered now! And here are stats, too. Go ahead and share it.

**Results** - Here's how the email did. After the email finishes running, the Results card displays the engagement score and other stats.

## Moments Stream {#moments-stream}

When you first open the app or tap **Moments** in the menu, relevant cards show first. Each one contains information about that specific marketing initiative and its overall performance.

Tapping the card opens a detail screen.

>Orange cards are confirmed; gray ones are tentative.

>**Definition**
>
>* Favorite: It's easy to pay attention to the stuff that's most timely and important if you make them favorites.
>* Done: Done gets it off your Marketo Moments view (but leaves it in Marketo, safe and sound). 
>* Share: Send an image to motivate or congratulate your team.
>* Send Sample (email only): Use this to let others check out how your emails look before you send them out.
>* Preview Email (emails only): It's always a good idea to check out your emails in advance.
