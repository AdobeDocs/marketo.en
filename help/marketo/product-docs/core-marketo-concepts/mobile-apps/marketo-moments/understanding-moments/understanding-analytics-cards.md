# Understanding Analytics Cards {#understanding-analytics-cards}

At the beginning of each month, Marketo Moments provides three different report cards: Acquired Leads, New Leads, and Unsubscribes. Each one shows you monthly performance and the trend over a six-month period.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>On October 2, 2023, Adobe removed the Marketo Moments App from all App Stores. If you already have the app installed on your tablet/mobile device, you can continue using it for the time being. Once your Marketo Engage instance is migrated to Adobe Identity for authentication of Marketo, you will no longer be able to access the app. [Learn more](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-discussions/marketo-events-app-and-marketo-moments-app-end-of-life/m-p/340712/highlight/true#M193869){target="_blank"}.

## Analytics Cards {#analytics-cards}

When you tap an Analytics card you can:

* [Make it a favorite](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/creating-a-favorite.md)
* [Mark it as done](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/marking-it-done.md)
* [Share it](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/sharing-a-moment.md)

Tap an Analytics card to show:

* A graph for the last six months' results
* A month-over month comparison
* A bar chart of the most or top three (depending on the card)

For example, let's take a look at the details for the Acquired Leads Analytics card:

In this example, red indicates the value has decreased over the selected date range (uh oh!). Green indicates the value has increased (yay!).
