# Understanding Smart Campaign Cards {#understanding-smart-campaign-cards}

Use Marketo Moments to view each run of your Smart Campaigns from your smart phone or iPad. The Marketo Moments Smart Campaign card represents a single run of a  campaign; a new card appears each time the Smart Campaign runs. Smart Campaign cards are marked with a light bulb at the upper left.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>On October 2, 2023, Adobe removed the Marketo Moments App from all App Stores. If you already have the app installed on your tablet/mobile device, you can continue using it for the time being. Once your Marketo Engage instance is migrated to Adobe Identity for authentication of Marketo, you will no longer be able to access the app. [Learn more](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-discussions/marketo-events-app-and-marketo-moments-app-end-of-life/m-p/340712/highlight/true#M193869){target="_blank"}.

For future Smart Campaigns that are scheduled but have not yet run, the Marketo Moments card doesn't display any campaign stats yet. They'll appear in a future release.

## Smart Campaign Cards {#smart-campaign-cards}

1. Tap the card to open the details card.

   ![](assets/image2015-9-21-11-3a7-3a52.png)

1. The details card gives you access to information on the [!UICONTROL Smart List] filters, [!UICONTROL Flow], and [!UICONTROL Email Summary].

1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Smart List]**.

   ![](assets/image2015-9-21-13-3a31-3a49.png)

1. The filters used by the smart list are shown here.

   ![](assets/image2015-9-21-13-3a35-3a29.png)

1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Flow]**.

   ![](assets/image2015-9-21-13-3a37-3a20.png)

1. Now, you'll see the flow of the Smart Campaign. This campaign has only one flow step, but there can be multiple ones.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Email Summary]**.

   ![](assets/image2015-9-21-13-3a51-3a7.png)

   ![](assets/image2015-9-21-13-3a59-3a29.png)

1. See those two dots at the bottom? They indicate that there are two emails connected to this Smart Campaign. To view results for the other email, swipe the screen to the left. Here are the results for the second email.

   >Notice that the other dot is highlighted now.

## Creating Email Samples and Previews {#creating-email-samples-and-previews}

It's a good idea to get a look at an email before it goes out. Or, send a sample to someone else to get a second set of eyes on it.

1. Tap the three-dot action menu on an email.

   ![](assets/image2015-9-22-14-3a54-3a12.png)

1. Tap [[!UICONTROL Send Sample]](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/sending-a-sample.md) or [[!UICONTROL Preview Email]](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/marketo-moments/working-with-moments/previewing-an-email.md) (click these links for details).

1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Confirm]**.
