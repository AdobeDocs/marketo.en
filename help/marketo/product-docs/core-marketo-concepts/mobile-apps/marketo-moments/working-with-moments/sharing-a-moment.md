>On October 2, 2023, Adobe removed the Marketo Moments App from all App Stores. If you already have the app installed on your tablet/mobile device, you can continue using it for the time being. Once your Marketo Engage instance is migrated to Adobe Identity for authentication of Marketo, you will no longer be able to access the app. [Learn more](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-discussions/marketo-events-app-and-marketo-moments-app-end-of-life/m-p/340712/highlight/true#M193869){target="_blank"}.

   >Sharing depends on the apps installed on your phone. So, if you don't have Facebook, you won't see it in Moments.
