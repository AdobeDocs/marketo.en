# Set up the iPad or Android Tablet {#set-up-the-ipad-or-android-tablet}

For a smooth experience on event day, prepare your iPad or Android tablet and test the Marketo Events app before the event.

After you've created the event in Marketo, it loads into the Marketo Events iPad or Android app when you log in, if:

* The account has access to your database
* The event is scheduled on a date in the time period that starts one week before and ends one week after the current date
* The event was created in the appropriate channel (for example, Roadshow)

>You must be connected to the Internet to download apps.
