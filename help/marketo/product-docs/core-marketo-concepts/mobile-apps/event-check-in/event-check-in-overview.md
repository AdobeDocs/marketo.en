# Event Check-in Overview {#event-check-in-overview}

The Marketo Events app for iPad or Android tablet makes it easy to check people in immediately when they arrive at your event.

This article outlines the complete process. The headings are linked to the separate articles, and some Marketo activities are links in this outline.

Some activities happen before the event, such as creating a new role and inviting attendees. Some happen during the event, such as checking in attendees. After the event, you sync your data with Marketo, updating the person's status.

Have a great event!
