# Prepare for Your Event {#prepare-for-your-event}

There are several things you have to do to get ready for the event.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

## Create a New Marketo Role {#create-a-new-marketo-role}

Marketo has a special user role for the event check-in app.  [Create a new Marketo role](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Grant+User+Access+to+the+Check-in+App) for iPad or Android users, with permission to access the mobile application.

## Invite New Tablet Users to the Event {#invite-new-tablet-users-to-the-event}

[Invite new tablet users to the event](https://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Grant+User+Access+to+the+Check-in+App) and assign them the new role.

## Create a New Marketo Event Program {#create-a-new-marketo-event-program}

[Create a new Marketo event program](../../../../product-docs/demand-generation/events/understanding-events/create-a-new-event-program.md) to capture the status of your people as they progress through different stages and get accurate measures of the ROI for your marketing initiatives.

   >[!CAUTION]

   >If the date of the Event is more than one week before or after the current date, your event will not appear in the app. **Tip**: To test it, temporarily set the dates to within one week of today. Remember to return the event to the correct dates after you test it.
