# Prepare for Your Event {#prepare-for-your-event}

There are several things you have to do to get ready for the event.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>On October 2, 2023, Adobe removed the Marketo Events App from all App Stores. If you already have the app installed on your tablet/mobile device, you can continue using it for the time being. Once your Marketo Engage instance is migrated to Adobe Identity for authentication of Marketo, you will no longer be able to access the app. [Learn more](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-discussions/marketo-events-app-and-marketo-moments-app-end-of-life/m-p/340712/highlight/true#M193869){target="_blank"}.

## Create a New Marketo Role {#create-a-new-marketo-role}

Marketo has a special user role for the event check-in app. [Create a new Marketo role](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/event-check-in/grant-users-access-to-the-check-in-app.md) for iPad or Android users, with permission to access the mobile application.

## Invite New Tablet Users to the Event {#invite-new-tablet-users-to-the-event}

[Invite new tablet users to the event](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/mobile-apps/event-check-in/grant-users-access-to-the-check-in-app.md) and assign them the new role.

## Create a New Marketo Event Program {#create-a-new-marketo-event-program}

[Create a new Marketo event program](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/events/understanding-events/create-a-new-event-program.md) to capture the status of your people as they progress through different stages and get accurate measures of the ROI for your marketing initiatives.

## Specify the Event Dates {#specify-the-event-dates}

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >If the date of the Event is more than one week before or after the current date, your event will not appear in the app. **Tip**: To test it, temporarily set the dates to within one week of today. Remember to return the event to the correct dates after you test it.

## Add People to Your Event {#add-people-to-your-event}

Now that you know the *when*, it's time to add the *who*.

1. If you already have a list of people, in My Marketo, click the **Database** tile.
