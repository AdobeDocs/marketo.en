# Create a Program Analyzer {#create-a-program-analyzer}

Discover which programs and channels are giving you the biggest bang for your marketing buck. Use the program analyzer to scrutinize and compare every cost and return in detail, by program or by channel.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To get good data from a program analyzer, make sure your CRM contacts have roles in the opportunities, and that your Marketo programs are fully set up, with [period costs](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics/revenue-tools/define-period-costs.md), program statuses, and success defined.

>[!TIP]
>
>To make programs with no cost appear in the program analyzer, [set their period cost](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics/revenue-tools/define-period-costs.md) to $0.
