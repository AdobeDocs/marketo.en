# Attribution Example 3 {#attribution-example}

Read the following scenario and try to determine the numbers that should be in the grid.

* April 11 | Steve downloads (Content) - success
* April 22 | Opportunity is created for $3,000 (Both Steve and Jason have roles)
* April 25 | Jason attends (Webinar) - success
* April 30 | Opportunity is Closed-Won

| Attribution Metric |(Content) |(Webinar) |
|---|---|---|
| (MT) Opty Created |`<pre>1</pre>` |`<pre>0</pre>` |
| (MT) Pipeline Created |`<pre>$3,000</pre>` |`<pre>$0</pre>` |
| (MT) Opty Won |`<pre>0.5</pre>` |`<pre>0.5</pre>` |
| (MT) Revenue Won |`<pre>$1,500</pre>` |`<pre>$1,500</pre>` |

>**Explanation**
>
>Remember attribution rule #3. Jason had program success AFTER the opty was created. Therefore, the webinar can't get credit for the creation of the opportunity. Only credit for the Opty won.
>
>Therefore, (Content) has 100% of credit for the Opty creation and pipeline, but only 50% credit for the opty won.
