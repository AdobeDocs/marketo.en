# Define Period Costs {#define-period-costs}

>[!NOTE]

>**Definition**

>A period cost is the amount you spend on a program. It can be for one or more months and is used for reporting ROI.

Track and associate lead nurturing and lead acquisition costs for a Program or Event by defining when and where you want to take costs for leads. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>At the beginning of a Program, enter forecasted costs. Once the period in the Program completes, you can edit the Period Cost and enter in the actual cost. This will provide you with accurate reporting results.
