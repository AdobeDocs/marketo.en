# Using the Success Path Analyzer {#using-the-success-path-analyzer}

Use a Success Path Analyzer to explore the specific details that reflect both flow (amount) and velocity (speed, in terms of days) of people through the stages of your [Revenue Cycle Model](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics/revenue-cycle-models/understanding-revenue-models.md).
