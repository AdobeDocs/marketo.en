## Success Path {#success-path}

In the model, the green path aka the **Success Path** is the optimal path of how a lead linearly transitions to a closed/won business.

Example Stages on a Success Path:

| **SUCCESS PATH STAGE NAME** |**DEFINITION** |
|---|---|
| **Review New Names** |Review if new names are qualified |
| **Prospect** |Qualified prospects who are not yet sales ready |
| **Lead** |Marketing qualified leads (“sales ready”) |
| **Opportunity** |Sales accepted leads, actively working |
| **Customer** |Closed Won deals |

>Green is for money. Everything on the path of green is on the path to success! That's why there are only green arrows in the [Success Path Analyzer](using-the-success-path-analyzer.md).

## Detours {#detours}

Recognizing that not all leads follow a linear “success path”, you should also define your “detour stages” to capture leads that are not qualified, or that require a few rounds of nurturing before becoming ready. For example:

| **DETOUR STAGE NAME** |**DEFINITION** |
|---|---|
| **Disqualified** |Names marked as not-in profile |
| **Inactive** |Prospects that have gone non-responsive |
| **Recycled** |Qualified but needs more nurturing (linked to Prospect) |
| **Lost** |Lost opportunities (ongoing nurturing) |

>These are not on the green path. These stages won't be shown in the Success Path Analyzer.

Seeing how leads will flow in the future will be that much easier! Say hello to your new little friend.
