# Set [!DNL Google AdWords] Conversions in the Revenue Model with a Manager Account {#set-google-adwords-conversions-in-the-revenue-model-with-a-manager-account}

Link your [!DNL Google AdWords] account to Marketo to automatically upload offline conversion data from Marketo to [!DNL Google AdWords]. Then, from the [!DNL AdWords] UI, you will be able to easily see which clicks resulted in qualified leads, opportunities and new customers (or whatever revenue stages you want to track) after you [add custom columns](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/3073556) in [!DNL AdWords].

If you have multiple [!DNL Google Adwords] accounts, you can use a [[!DNL Google AdWords] Manager Account](https://www.google.com/adwords/manager-accounts/) (formerly known as My Client Center) to integrate them with Marketo.

You can map [!DNL AdWords] offline conversions to one or more stages in a Revenue model. There are two ways:

* Stage Action
* [!DNL AdWords] Mapping

## Pro tip: Add a New Conversion {#pro-tip-add-a-new-conversion}

Pro tip! A new [!DNL AdWords] offline conversion can be created from Marketo.

1. Under the **[!UICONTROL Stage Actions]** drop down, select **[!UICONTROL Set AdWords Conversion]**.
