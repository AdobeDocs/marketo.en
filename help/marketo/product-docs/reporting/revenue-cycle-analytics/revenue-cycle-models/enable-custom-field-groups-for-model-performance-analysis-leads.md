   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >This example enabled a custom field group for a standard field (State). Therefore, only the [!UICONTROL Model Performance Analysis (Leads)] Area was impacted. If a custom field group for a custom person or company field had been enabled, the enabled group would display in the [!UICONTROL Model Performance Analysis (Leads)] section of the Sync Summary tab and the custom field count for Lead, Campaign, and Opportunity Analysis would increase by one.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
