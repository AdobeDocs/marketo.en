When you create your model and select and organize your inventory stages, it's time to set the transitions.

1. Right-click (you can also double-click) one of the arrows to get started, and select **Edit Transition**.

>'Anonymous â‡’ Known' transition rules cannot be edited.

2. A new tab will open for the transition you selected.   ![](assets/three-1.png)

3. Transitions control how leads move between stages. Drag the trigger (or filter) of your choice from the right, and release anywhere onto the canvas. In this example, we'll select the Fills Out Form trigger.

>[!TIP]
>
>Because the revenue modeler is setting you up for reporting, it's recommended that the transitions always include triggers. That way your reports will reflect the true velocity of your model/stage flow. Filters can be added with the triggers for additional constraints.
