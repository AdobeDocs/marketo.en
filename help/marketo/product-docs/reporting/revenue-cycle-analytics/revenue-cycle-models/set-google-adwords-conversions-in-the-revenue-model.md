# Set [!DNL Google AdWords] Conversions in the Revenue Model {#set-google-adwords-conversions-in-the-revenue-model}

Link your [!DNL Google AdWords] account to Marketo to automatically upload offline conversion data from Marketo to [!DNL Google AdWords]. Then, from the [!DNL AdWords] UI, you will be able to easily see which clicks resulted in qualified leads, opportunities and new customers (or whatever revenue stages you want to track) after you [add custom columns](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/3073556) in [!DNL AdWords].

>[!NOTE]
>
>This is a push integration from Marketo to [!DNL Google AdWords]. Conversion data will appear _only_ in your [!DNL Google AdWords] portal, _not in the Marketo UI_.

Learn more about [Googleâ€™s offline conversion import feature](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2998031?hl=en). Map [!DNL AdWords] offline conversions to one or more stages in a Revenue model. There are three ways to do the mapping:

* [!DNL AdWords] Conversion
* Stage Action
* [!DNL AdWords] Mapping

You can create a new [!DNL AdWords] offline conversion from Marketo if you use Stage Action.
