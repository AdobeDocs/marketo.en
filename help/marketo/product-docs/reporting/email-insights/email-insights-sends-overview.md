**Type** indicates the kind of asset used.   
**Recipient** number is how many people were sent the email.   
**Delivery Metrics** gives you a quick view of how many emails were delivered, are pending, or have bounced.  
**Engagement Metrics** gives you a quick view of how many recipients have opened, clicked in, and unsubscribed from an email.   
**Score** is your email's [Engagement Score](../../../product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing/reports-and-notifications/understanding-the-engagement-score.md).

By default your emails are sorted by most recent, but you can sort them by any available metric.
