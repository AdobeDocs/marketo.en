[Filtering](filtering-in-email-insights.md) is available to help you drill down for specific metrics.

Key Points of Interest (KPI) tiles give you a quick look at the more popular metrics.

>[!TIP]
>
>Those colors mean something! Green indicates a good change, red means a bad change, gray means nothing has changed. This is based on the comparison period you've chosen in filtering.

The chart displays your filtered criteria. To hide one of your filters, simply click its color bar...

`

...and the metric disappears from the chart. Click the color bar again to make it reappear.

If you create a chart you'd like to use again, make it a [quick chart](email-insights-quick-charts.md).
