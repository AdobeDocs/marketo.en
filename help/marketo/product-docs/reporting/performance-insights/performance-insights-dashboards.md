Measuring Audience Engagement

Choose the **[!UICONTROL Successes]** metric to measure audience engagement in your nurture programs. Success is a measure of meaningful interaction in Marketo.

![](assets/3-4.png)

The purpose of a program is to create a meaningful interaction with the person or prospect. Success is marked when a person reaches the status that achieves that goal. It can be attending a webinar, clicking a link in an email, or filling out a web form. Success varies depending on the program channel.

>[!NOTE]
>
>In a webinar program, there can be multiple statuses, such as: Invited, Registered, and Attended. Invited or Registered aren't meaningful interactions because people don't actually watch the webinar. Attended is considered success in this case.

Measuring New Name Acquisition

Choose the **[!UICONTROL New Names]** metric to measure the effectiveness of your new name acquisition programs.
