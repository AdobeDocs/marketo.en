# Delete a Report {#delete-a-report}

Once you start [creating reports](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/creating-reports/create-a-report-in-a-program.md), you can quickly end up with a lot of them. Remember to delete reports you no longer need.

1. Right-click the unneeded report in the tree and select **Delete Report**.
