In the [[!UICONTROL Web Page Activity]](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/report-types/web-page-activity-report.md) and  [[!UICONTROL Company Web Activity] reports](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/report-types/company-web-activity-report.md) you can see either [people or anonymous visitors](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/managing-people-in-smart-lists/understanding-anonymous-activity-and-people.md) who visit your site. The anonymous visitors have inferred data, such as Metro Area.  Here's how to select whether the report displays known leads or anonymous visitors.

1. In your [!UICONTROL Web Page Activity] report, click **[!UICONTROL Setup]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Including ISPs for anonymous visitors generates a longer report, but excluding them provides a clearer view of where your visitors are coming from besides the standard sources, such as Google.

1. That's it. Click the **[!UICONTROL Report]** tab to go back and view your report with known or anonymous people.
