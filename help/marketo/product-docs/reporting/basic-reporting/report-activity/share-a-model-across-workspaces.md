Share a Model Across Workspaces - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Marketo gives you the ability to share a model(s) across workspaces. Here's how.

>[!NOTE]

>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

1. Go to the **Analytics** section.

1. Select the workspaces you want to share the folder with and click **Save**.

It's that easy! Now people from other workspaces can move through the shared model. You may want to run person assignment in that workspace, see&nbsp; [Launching Your Revenue Cycle Model](https://community.marketo.com/MarketoArticle?id=kA050000000KyvQCAS)&nbsp;for details.
