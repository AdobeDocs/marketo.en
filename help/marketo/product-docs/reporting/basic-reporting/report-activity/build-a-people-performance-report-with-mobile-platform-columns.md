   >[!TIP]
   >
   >We used the [!UICONTROL Opened Email] filter in this example. You can also use the [!UICONTROL Clicked Email] filter as it has the Platform constraint.

1. Set [!UICONTROL Platform] to **[!UICONTROL iOS]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >At least one person must have opened one of your emails on an iOS device in order for Marketo's autosuggest to find it. If it does not come up, you can manually type it in and save.

   Now create a second smart list for the "Android" platform. Once that's done, move on to the next section.
