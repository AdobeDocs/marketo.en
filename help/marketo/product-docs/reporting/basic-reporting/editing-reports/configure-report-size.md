   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Changing the limit changes the report size itself, not just the exported [!DNL Excel] file, so if your report is taking too long to generate, reduce the limit!

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to confirm the new limit.

   You're done! The report will abide by the new limit.

   >You can [export your report](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/report-activity/export-a-report-to-excel.md) with the new limit.
