# Report Type Overview {#report-type-overview}

When you [create a report in a program](../../../../product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/creating-reports/create-a-report-in-a-program.md), choose what type of report you want.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).
