# People by Status Report {#people-by-status-report}

Review how well you're moving people through the process by checking how many of them appear in each _[!UICONTROL Person Status]_ value every month.

1. [Create a report](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/creating-reports/create-a-report-in-a-program.md) and select the **[!UICONTROL People by Status]** [report type](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/report-types/report-type-overview.md).

1. [Set the time frame of your report](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/editing-reports/change-a-report-time-frame.md) and click the **[!UICONTROL Report]** tab.

1. Great! Now you can see how many people were in each _[!UICONTROL Person Status]_, from month to month.
