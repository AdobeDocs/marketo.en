# Edit a Smart List Subscription {#edit-a-smart-list-subscription}

You can edit these columns directly in the Subscriptions tab, which appears in Marketing Activities or Database:

* [!UICONTROL Recipients]
* [!UICONTROL Frequency]
* [!UICONTROL Columns]
* [!UICONTROL End Delivery]
* [!UICONTROL Format]

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Database]** (we're using it in this example, but Marketing Activities works exactly the same).

1. Select the subscription you want to edit.

1. Click in the **[!UICONTROL Recipients]** column and it opens so you can enter more email addresses (separate them with a comma).

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Columns]** column and use the selector to add or remove columns from the report. Report Columns contains all available columns and Marketo Columns shows only those you've selected to display in your report. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The columns under Marketo Columns are the report columns, not the ones used in the Subscriptions report tab.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL End Date]** column to edit the end date. Select **[!UICONTROL Never]** or **[!UICONTROL Date]**. For a date, enter it or choose it from the calendar. Click **[!UICONTROL Approve]**.

1. The last piece of the puzzle is the format. Click the **[!UICONTROL Format]** column and select the one you want. CSV is the default.
