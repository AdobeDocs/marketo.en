# Toggle Switch {#toggle-switch}

The Toggle Switch allows you to switch between Marketo's classic interface and the Modern UX. It's available in all of the areas highlighted below.

>[!NOTE]

>When the Toggle Switch is selected, all existing workflows will be autosaved prior to the UI change occurring. If an operation is already in progress (ex: an asset is in the process of being approved), you'll receive an error message indicating as such and should try again after the operation is completed.

## Enable the Toggle Switch for Individual Roles {#enable-the-toggle-switch-for-individual-roles}
