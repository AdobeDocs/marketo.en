# Overview {#overview}

Welcome to the Adobe Marketo Engage Modern UX (user experience), an updated interface that provides enhanced usability along with a new look and feel across the Marketo Engage platform.

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>If your IT team restricts web access using an allowlist, ask them to add the following domains (including the asterisk) to allow all Marketo resources and websockets:
>
>* *.marketo.com
>* *.marketodesigner.com
>* *.mktoweb.com

## Take the Tour {#take-the-tour}

At first log in, a pop-up will appear, ready to give you the rundown of the new experience. Heads up, if you choose to skip it, it will **not** be available later.

The tour walks you through everything you need to know!

## What's New {#whats-new}

There's a lot of new functionality in the Modern UX, all of which is designed to significantly improve your marketing experience.

**Icons**

The new interface features improved and expanded iconography. Learn about them here: [Icon Glossary](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-engage-modern-ux/icon-glossary.md).

**Global Navigation**

Goodbye superball. You now have quick access to all of the main Marketo Engage sections.

**Instance URL**

You also have quick access to your munchkin ID, which is now reflected in your instance's URL (even more helpful to those with multiple subscriptions).

## New Tree Options {#new-tree-options}

There are a ton of new tree features available.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Performing a search in the tree will only display the first 250 results. If after a search you are unable to locate your asset, please use the [Global Search](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-engage-modern-ux/using-the-global-search.md) function.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Everything that used to live in the superball drop-down is still available as a tile in your My Marketo.

>[!TIP]
>
>Using the search in the tree will only yield results from the section you're in (e.g., Marketing Activities). If you'd like to search your entire instance, use the global search.

Enjoy the new Marketo Engage experience!
