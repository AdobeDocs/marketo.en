# Use "Date/Time" A/B Testing {#use-date-time-a-b-testing}

You can easily A/B test your emails. One test is the **[!UICONTROL Date/Time]** test. This tests what time of day or day of week is best to send emails. Here's how to set it up.

>[Add an A/B Test](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/add-an-a-b-test.md)
>

1. Under the **[!UICONTROL Email]** tile, click **[!UICONTROL Add A/B Test]**.

1. If you have previous test information (like a subject test), you can safely click **[!UICONTROL Reset Test]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The different variations will apply to equal portions of the chosen Test Sample Size.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >**We recommend you avoid setting the sample size to 100%**. If you're using a static list, setting the sample size to 100% sends the email to everyone in the audience and the winner goes to no one. If you're using a **smart** list, setting the sample size to 100% sends the email to everyone in the audience _at that time_. When the email program runs again at a later date, any new people who qualify for the smart list will also receive the email since they're now included in the audience.

   Okay, we're one step closer. Now we need to [define the A/B test winner criteria](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/define-the-a-b-test-winner-criteria.md).
