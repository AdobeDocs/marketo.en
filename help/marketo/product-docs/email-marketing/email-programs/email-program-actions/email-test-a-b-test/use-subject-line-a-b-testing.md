# Use "Subject Line" A/B Testing {#use-subject-line-a-b-testing}

You can easily A/B test your emails. One of the most common tests is the **Subject Line** test.

1. Under the Email tile, with your email selected, click Add A/B Test.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >**We recommend you avoid setting the sample size to 100%**. If you're using a static list, setting the sample size to 100% would send the email to everyone in the audience and the winner would go to no one. If you're using a smart list, setting the sample size to 100% would send the email to everyone in the audience _at that time_. And when the email program runs again at a later date, any new people who qualify for the smart list would also receive the email since they are now included in the audience.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The different subject variations will take even parts of the Test Sample Size selected.

   Okay, we're almost there. Now we need to [define the A/B test winner criteria](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/define-the-a-b-test-winner-criteria.md).
