# Understanding Email Testing Options {#understanding-email-testing-options}

Test your emails to improve their engagement score. There are two kinds of email testing in Marketo.

## A/B Testing {#a-b-testing}

This is for one-time emails using email programs. Add [A/B testing](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/add-an-a-b-test.md) and a small group will get the test and the rest will get the winner.

## Email Champion/Challenger {#email-champion-challenger}

For ongoing emails used in trigger smart campaigns or engagement programs, you can add [email champion/challenger](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/functions-in-the-editor/email-tests-champion-challenger/add-an-email-champion-challenger.md) testing. This will introduce variations to an ongoing percentage of the recipients.

Happy Testing!
