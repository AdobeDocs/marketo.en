# Understanding Email Testing Options {#understanding-email-testing-options}

Test your emails to improve their engagement score. There are two kinds of email testing in Marketo.

#### A/B Testing {#a-b-testing}

This is for one-time emails using [email programs](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/email+programs). Add [A/B testing](add-an-a-b-test.md) and a small group will get the test and the rest will get the winner.

#### Email Champion/Challenger {#email-champion-challenger}

For ongoing emails used in trigger smart campaigns or [engagement programs](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/drip+nurturing), you can add [email champion/challenger](http://docs.marketo.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageid=2359551) testing. This will introduce variations to an ongoing percentage of the recipients.

Happy Testing!
