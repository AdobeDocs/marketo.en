# Use "Whole Email" A/B Testing {#use-whole-email-a-b-testing}

You can easily A/B test your emails. One great test is the **Whole Email** test. Here's how to set it up.

>[!PREREQUISITES]

>[Add an A/B Test](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/add-an-a-b-test.md)

1. Under the Email tile, with your email selected, click **Add A/B Test**.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can add multiple emails. If you add too many, however, it can slow the testing process way down.

1. Select your second email.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The different variations will send to equal portions of the chosen **Test Sample Size**.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >**We recommend you avoid setting the sample size to 100%**. If you're using a static list, setting the sample size to 100% sends the email to everyone in the audience and the winner goes to no one. If you're using a **smart** list, setting the sample size to 100% sends the email to everyone in the audience _at that time_. When the email program runs again at a later date, any new people who qualify for the smart list will also receive the email since they're now included in the audience.

   Okay, we're almost there. Now we need to [define the A/B test winner criteria](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/define-the-a-b-test-winner-criteria.md).
