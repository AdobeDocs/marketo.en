Once you've [created an email program](../../../../product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/creating-an-email-program/create-an-email-program.md) and defined your audience, you will want to decide what email you're sending. You can  [create an email for an email program](create-an-email-for-an-email-program.md) from scratch or pick one that already exists. Here's how to pick one that already exists.

1. Go to **Marketing Activities**.

Now that we've decided what email to send, we can set up an A/B Test, or skip that and schedule the email program.
