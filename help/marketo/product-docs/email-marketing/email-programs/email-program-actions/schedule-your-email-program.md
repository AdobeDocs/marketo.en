1. You can also choose to use the [[!UICONTROL Recipient Time Zone]](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/scheduling-with-recipient-time-zone/schedule-email-programs-with-recipient-time-zone.md) and/or [[!UICONTROL Head Start]](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/head-start-for-email-programs.md) features.

   How easy was that? The only thing left is to [approve an email program](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/approve-unapprove-an-email-program.md) and you're good to go.
