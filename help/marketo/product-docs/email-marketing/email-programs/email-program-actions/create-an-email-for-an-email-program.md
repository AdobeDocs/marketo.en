Once you have created your email program and defined your audience, you'll want to decide what email you're sending. You can [choose an existing email](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/choose-an-existing-email.md) or create one from scratch. Here's how to create a new email.

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing Activities]**.
