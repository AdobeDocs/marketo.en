# Enable/Disable Communication Limits in an Email Program {#enable-disable-communication-limits-in-an-email-program}

When running an email program, you can choose to ignore or respect the [admin level communication limits](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/email-setup/enable-communication-limits.md). Here's how to do it.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Communication limits are [set in the Admin section](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/email-setup/enable-communication-limits.md) and help you avoid sending one person too many emails.

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing Activities]**.

1. By default, non-operational emails are blocked if communication limits are reached, but if you want to bypass them, clear the checkbox and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   Leaving **[!UICONTROL Block non-operational emails]** checked will prevent sending the email to anyone who has received more emails than your admin settings allow.
