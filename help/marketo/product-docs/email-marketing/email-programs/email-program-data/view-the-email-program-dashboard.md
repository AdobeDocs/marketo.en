# View the Email Program Dashboard {#view-the-email-program-dashboard}

Check out how your email program (with or without an A/B test) is performing with this dashboard.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>For accurate reporting, avoid _reusing_ an email from an email program, either by referencing it in a Smart Campaign or by moving the asset from the launched email program to a new one. Doing so will aggregate all of the data in every reporting dashboard attached to that email. If you need to reuse an email, please [clone it](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/programs/working-with-programs/clone-an-asset-in-a-program.md){target="_blank"} instead, as that copies the email but creates a new one with a new email ID.

## Select your Email Program {#select-your-email-program}

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing Activities]**.
