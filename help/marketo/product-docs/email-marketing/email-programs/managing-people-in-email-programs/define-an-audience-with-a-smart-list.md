# Define an Audience with a Smart List {#define-an-audience-with-a-smart-list}

Once you [create an email program](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/creating-an-email-program/create-an-email-program.md), you will want to tell it who to send the email to. You can do this by [importing a list of people](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/managing-people-in-email-programs/define-an-audience-by-importing-a-list.md) or with a smart list. Here's how to accomplish this with a smart list.

   Excellent work! Now it's time to [choose an existing email](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/choose-an-existing-email.md) or [create an email](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/create-an-email-for-an-email-program.md) to send to these people.
