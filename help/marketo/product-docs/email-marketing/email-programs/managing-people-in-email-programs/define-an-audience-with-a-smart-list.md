# Define an Audience with a Smart List {#define-an-audience-with-a-smart-list}

Once you&nbsp; [create an email program](../../../../product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/creating-an-email-program/create-an-email-program.md), you will want to tell it who to send the email to. You can do this by&nbsp; [importing a list of people](define-an-audience-by-importing-a-list.md)&nbsp;or with a smart list. Here's how to accomplish this with a smart list.

   Excellent work! Now it's time to [choose an existing email](../../../../product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/choose-an-existing-email.md) or to [create an email](../../../../product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/create-an-email-for-an-email-program.md) to send to these people.

>Did you notice the Blocked number? This number is a subset of the people that qualified and represents people that cannot be sent this email because they are:
>
>* Unsubscribed
>* Marketing Suspended
>* Blocklisted
>* Email Invalid
>* Empty Email
>
>Click the number for a detailed list of people blocked from mailings. **Please note:** Operational emails will still be sent to people marked unsubscribed and marketing suspended.

>Use the&nbsp; ![--](assets/image2014-10-23-16-3a32-3a36.png)&nbsp;button on the&nbsp;Audience&nbsp;tile to see how many people will receive the email.
