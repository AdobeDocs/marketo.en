# Understanding Email Programs {#understanding-email-programs}

Send out emails, create A/B tests, and track your results all in one place.

## Control Panel {#control-panel}

Four boxes keep you focused. **[!UICONTROL Audience]** defines the "who," **[!UICONTROL Email]** provides the "what," **[!UICONTROL Schedule]** defines "when," and **[!UICONTROL Approval]** makes it ready to go.

## A/B Testing {#a-b-testing}

A/B testing allows you to prove which email is best.

Learn about the following A/B tests:

* ["Subject Line" A/B Testing](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/use-subject-line-a-b-testing.md)
* ["Whole Email" A/B Testing](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/use-whole-email-a-b-testing.md)
* ["From Address" A/B Testing](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/use-from-address-a-b-testing.md)
* ["Date/Time" A/B Testing](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs/email-program-actions/email-test-a-b-test/use-date-time-a-b-testing.md)

## Dashboards {#dashboards}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>For accurate reporting, avoid _reusing_ an email from an email program, either by referencing it in a Smart Campaign or by moving the asset from the launched email program to a new one. Doing so will aggregate all of the data in every reporting dashboard attached to that email. If you need to reuse an email, please [clone it](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/programs/working-with-programs/clone-an-asset-in-a-program.md){target="_blank"} instead, as that copies the email but creates a new one with a new email ID.

Enjoy the fruits of your labor. Dashboards show you email program and A/B test performance at a glance.

>[!TIP]
>
>Some prefer using email programs over sending an email via a Smart Campaign because of the program's detailed reporting dashboard.

## Nesting {#nesting}

Email programs play well with other programs.

Use an email program to send out a webinar invitation, for example.

Use an email program inside a default program to keep things organized.

>[!TIP]
>
>In order to get an existing email program into another program, you have to clone it.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Email programs cannot be nested in [engagement programs](/help/marketo/getting-started/quick-wins/drip-drip-nurture.md). They also can't be re-sent, and can only run one test at a time.
