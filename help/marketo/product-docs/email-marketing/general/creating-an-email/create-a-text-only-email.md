# Create a Text Only Email {#create-a-text-only-email}

If you ever want to send text only emails, here's how to create an email that will go out without any HTML content.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Because opens are tracked by the recipient downloading the email's images (which includes an invisible tracking pixel), opens are **not** able to be tracked for Text Only emails.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Marketing Activities]** area.

   >[!TIP]
