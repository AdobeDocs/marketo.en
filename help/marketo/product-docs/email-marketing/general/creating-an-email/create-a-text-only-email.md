# Create a Text Only Email {#create-a-text-only-email}

If you ever want to send text only emails, here's how to create an email that will go out without any HTML content.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Because opens are tracked by the recipient downloading the email's images (which includes an invisible tracking pixel), opens are **not** able to be tracked for Text Only emails.

1. Go to the **Marketing Activities** area.

   >Links are not automatically tracked in text only emails. See how to  [Add Tracked Links to a Text Email](../../../../product-docs/email-marketing/general/functions-in-the-editor/add-tracked-links-to-a-text-email.md).

1. Uncheck the **Automatically copy from HTML** checkbox.
