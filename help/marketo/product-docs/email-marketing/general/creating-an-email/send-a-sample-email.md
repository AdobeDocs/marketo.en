# Send a Sample Email {#send-a-sample-email}

It's quick and easy to send samples of an email. To send a dynamic content email, see  [Preview an Email with Dynamic Content](../../../../product-docs/email-marketing/general/functions-in-the-editor/preview-an-email-with-dynamic-content.md).

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

>You must have the **Access Database - Run Single Flow Actions** permission to send sample emails.
