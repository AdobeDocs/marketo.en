# Create an Email {#create-an-email}

There are two main ways to create an email in Marketo. Let's look at both.

## Create an Email in the Design Studio {#create-an-email-in-the-design-studio}

1. Go to the **Design Studio**.

Simple! Now for the other way...

   And that's it!

Whichever method you choose brings you to the template picker.

1. Give your email a name, click on the template you want to use, then click **Create**.

1. Enter a subject line. The recommended character limit is 50.

   Depending on the template you've chosen, you'll have different options in which to edit your email. For emails with modules, check out [Add Modules to your Email](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/email-editor-2/add-modules-to-your-email.md).

Your email is now created, so edit away!
