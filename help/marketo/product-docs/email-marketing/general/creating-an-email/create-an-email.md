# Create an Email {#create-an-email}

There are two main ways to create an email in Marketo. Let's look at both.

## Create an Email in the Design Studio {#create-an-email-in-the-design-studio}

1. Go to the **Design Studio**.

Simple! Now for the other way...

   And that's it!

Whichever method you choose brings you to the template picker.

1. Give your email a name, click on the template you want to use, then click **Create**.

   >You can choose from a collection of ready-to-go responsive email templates, or a template you saved by first selecting **My Templates**, and following the same steps.

1. Enter a subject line. There's a counter on the right to let you know if you're under the recommended 50 character max.

   Depending on the template you've chosen, you'll have different options in which to edit your email. For emails with modules, check out [Add Modules to your Email](../../../../product-docs/email-marketing/general/email-editor-2.0/add-modules-to-your-email.md).

Your email is now created, so edit away!
