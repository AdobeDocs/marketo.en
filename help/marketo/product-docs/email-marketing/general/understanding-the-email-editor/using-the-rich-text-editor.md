# Using the Rich Text Editor {#using-the-rich-text-editor}

The Rich Text Editor (RTE) appears throughout Marketo and is available whenever you want to add or edit content. You'll see a version of it on landing pages, programs, emails, forms, and snippets. Just click **[!UICONTROL Edit Draft]**, and it'll pop up to serve you.

## Editor Settings {#editor-settings}

The root block element setting defines which tags wrap your content. By default, the email root block element utilizes `<p>` tags. You have the option to change that by following the steps below.

>[!TIP]
>
>While you have the option to choose your root block element, we always recommend using default settings for the best user experience.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Admin]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Email]**.

   ![](assets/two.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Edit Text Editor Settings]**.

   ![](assets/three.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Email] / [!UICONTROL Snippet Editor]** drop-down, select `<div>` or [!UICONTROL None] and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. `<div>` is used in this example.

   If you have `<div class=“mktEditable”></div>` in an Email Template, you will see the following HTML Source behavior when you open the section and type “Text Goes Here” in the editor:

<table> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <th>&lt;p&gt;</th> 
   <th>&lt;div&gt;</th> 
   <th>None</th> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><p>&lt;div class=“mktEditable”&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Text Goes Here&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</p></td> 
   <td><p>&lt;div class=“mktEditable”&gt;<br>&lt;div&gt;Text Goes Here&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</p></td> 
   <td><p>&lt;div class=“mktEditable”&gt;<br>Text Goes Here<br>&lt;/div&gt;</p></td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can also change the Landing Page Editor's root block element by following the same steps, but clicking the **[!UICONTROL Landing Page Editor]** drop-down in Step 4 instead of [!UICONTROL Email] / [!UICONTROL Snippet Editor].

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The root block element is always `<p>` for rich-text program tokens.
