The new Email Designer is the latest innovation in Marketo Engage intended to provide a revamped email and email template creation experience to improve productivity and efficiency by providing a visual drag-and-drop editor along with standard out-of-the-box templates. Easily create customized email templates without having to spend money on vendors. 

Emails created in the new designer can be used in Smart Lists and Smart Campaigns. There are many more enhancements planned for the future to make the new designer even better.
