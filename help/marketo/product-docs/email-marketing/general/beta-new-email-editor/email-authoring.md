### Choose a template {#choose-a-template}

There are two types of templates to choose from.

   </table>

## Check Alerts {#check-alerts}

As you design your content, alerts are displayed on the top-right of the screen when key settings are missing.

There are two types of alerts:

**Warnings**

Warnings refer to recommendations and best practices, such as:

* **The opt-out link is not present in the email body**: While unsubscribe links are a requirement, adding them to the body of your email is a best practice.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adding an unsubscribe option is not required for [Operational Emails](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/functions-in-the-editor/make-an-email-operational.md) (non-marketing).

* **Text version of HTML is empty**: You must define a text version of your email body for when HTML content cannot be displayed.

* **Empty link is present in email body**: Verify all links in your email are correct.

* **Email size has exceeded the limit of 100KB**: For optimal delivery, make sure the size of your email does not exceed 100KB.

**Errors**

Errors prevent you from sending or testing the email until they are resolved:

* **Subject line is missing**: An email subject line is required.

* **Email version of the message is empty**: This error occurs when the email content has not been configured.

## Test your email

When your message content is defined, you can use test profiles to preview it, send proofs, and control how it renders in popular desktop, mobile, and web-based clients. If you inserted personalized content, you can check how it's displayed in the message using test profile data.

To preview your email content, click **Simulate content**, then add a test profile to check your message using the test profile data.

## Reference an email {#reference-an-email}

After you've created an email in the new editor, you can reference it in Smart Campaigns and/or Smart Lists like you would with any other email.

* Reference it in a Smart List by [following the usual steps](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/creating-a-smart-list/create-a-smart-list.md).

* Reference it in a Smart Campaign by [following the usual steps](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/creating-a-smart-campaign/create-a-new-smart-campaign.md).
