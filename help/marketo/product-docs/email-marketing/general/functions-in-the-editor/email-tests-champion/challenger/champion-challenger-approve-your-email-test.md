   >When approving a&nbsp;**Whole Email****&nbsp;**test, approve the challenger email first.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >To send the test out, choose the email you added the test to in the **Send Email** flow step of your trigger campaign. You also have the option of inserting that email into a stream of an engagement program. Champion/Challenger emails will not work in batch campaigns.

   Wasn't that easy? Once you receive a few reports you will want to declare a champion.
