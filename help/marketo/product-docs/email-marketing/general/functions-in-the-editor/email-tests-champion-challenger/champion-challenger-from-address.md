   >[!TIP]
   >
   >If you want more than one challenger, click the plus sign and enter another name and email.

   >**Example**
   >
   >In the distribution shown above, 15% of the total audience specified in the smart list gets one of the emails with a challenger From Address and 85% receive the email with the champion From Address. Emails for multiple challenger From Addresses share the 15% equally. When the test is over, you can declare a winner manually. From then on, all future people receive the better performing content.

   To gain statistical confidence, be sure you choose a percentage that includes enough people that your test is valid. Don't be fooled by inconclusive results. [More information than you ever wanted about statistical confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval).

1. Click **Next**.
