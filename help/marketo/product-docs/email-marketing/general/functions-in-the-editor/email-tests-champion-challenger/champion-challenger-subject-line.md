   >If you want more than one challenger, click the plus sign and enter another subject line.

   >**Example**
   >
   >
   >In the distribution shown above, 10% of the total audience specified in the smart list gets one of the emails with the challenger subject line and 90% receive emails with the champion subject line. Emails with multiple challenger subject lines share the 10% equally. When the test is over, you can declare a winner manually. From then on, all future people receive the better performing content.

   To gain statistical confidence, make sure the percentage you choose includes enough people, so that your test is valid. Don't be fooled by inconclusive results.  [More information than you ever wanted about statistical confidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval).
