   >**Example**
   >
   >In the distribution shown above, 15% of the total audience specified in the Smart List gets one of the challenger emails and 85% receive the champion email. Multiple challenger emails share the 15% equally. When the test is over, you can declare a winner manually. From then on, all future people receive the better performing content. In Trigger Campaigns, the realized percentage may differ from the percentage you select, as the distribution may not align precisely with the chosen percentages. This can happen when one variant processes a significant number of unsubscribed persons, or when one variant is an operational email while the others are not.

   To gain statistical confidence, be sure that the percentage you assign to challengers includes enough people that your test is valid. Don't be fooled by inconclusive results.

1. Click **Next**.
