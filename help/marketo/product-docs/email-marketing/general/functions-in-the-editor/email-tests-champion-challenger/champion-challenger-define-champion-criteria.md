   >We'll track this metric and send you a report with the data by email.

1. If you picked one of the default **Champion Criteria**, go ahead and move on to [Champion/Challenger: Configure Report Alerts](champion-challenger-configure-report-alerts.md)!

## Custom Champion Criteria {#custom-champion-criteria}

1. If you want to get fancy, you can go custom by selecting **Custom Conversion** and clicking **Edit**.

   >This allows you to set any event as a conversion by using triggers and filters.

   Marketo only allows triggers for people who have been sent the email from this email program. No need to add a "Was Sent Email" filter.

1. Click **Close**.
