# Make an Email Operational {#make-an-email-operational}

Operational emails ignore Unsubscribed and Marketing Suspended statuses. They are also not subject to communication limits. They send no matter what.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Operational emails do not count towards communication limits. For example, if someone can only receive one email per week and you've already sent them a marketing email, you can still send them an operational email if necessary.

1. Find your email, select it and click **[!UICONTROL Edit Draft]**.

1. Once the editor opens, click **[!UICONTROL Email Settings]**.

>Operational emails weren't designed to work with engagement programs. Thus, an engagement program will ignore an email's operational status. Please keep that in mind when working with them.
