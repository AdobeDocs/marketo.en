Snippets are reusable blocks of rich text and graphics that you can use in your emails and landing pages.

>You cannot embed any [Marketo email syntax](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/email-editor-2/email-template-syntax.md)in snippets; it will **not** work in an email. Snippets should just be body content (HTML + TEXT).

1. Find your email, select it and click **[!UICONTROL Edit Draft]**.

   >Each time you update and approve your snippet, the changes will be reflected in the email. The email will be drafted unless you approve the snippet with [No-Draft](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/enable-no-draft-for-snippets.md).

This is a quick and easy way to re-use dynamic content.
