# Edit an Email's HTML {#edit-an-emails-html}

Sometimes you may need to modify an email's underlying HTML. Sometimes you may use an external system to design and build your email's code. Either way, you can easily import and/or edit code from within the email editor.

## Edit HTML {#edit-html}

1. Select your email and click **Edit Draft**.

1. Click the **Code Actions** drop-down to download the code as an .html file, inline your CSS, or validate the HTML.

   >The best practice for emails is to make all your styles inline. Several email clients don't support CSS within the <head> section.

## Breaking an Email From its Template {#breaking-an-email-from-its-template}

These code changes **will not** break an email from its template:

* Editing the contents of any Module (including adding new Elements inside the Module)
* Adding a new Module to the Container
* Deleting a Module from the Container

* Changing mkto-specific attributes (for example, "mktoName" or "mktoImgUrl") of any Element outside of a Module
* Editing the contents of any Element (rich text, image, video, etc.) outside of a Module

These things you can do in the code editor **will **break the email from its template:

* Changing anything in the code outside of an Element or Module
* Adding or changing non-mkto attributes (for example, "id" or "style") of any Element outside of a Module
* Deleting an Element that is outside of a Module

## Search Code {#search-code}

Use the Search Code functionality to efficiently find and replace content within your emailâ€™s HTML code.

1. In your email's code, click **Search Code**.

   >Search Code is also available in the [Email Template editor](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Create+a+New+Email+Template).

We recommend that you continue to edit your emails using Marketo's built-in functionality, but this code editor does provide flexibility if you need it.
