# Edit Elements in an Email {#edit-elements-in-an-email}

Emails can contain four different elements: Rich text, Images, Snippets, and Video. Here's how to edit each.

## How to Edit the Rich Text Element {#how-to-edit-the-rich-text-element}

1. Find your email, select it and click **[!UICONTROL Edit Draft]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can also add images, tokens, tables and other elements. See [Using the Rich Text Editor](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/understanding-the-email-editor/using-the-rich-text-editor.md).

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >Avoid copying and pasting text from a rich text source, such as a website or a Word document. Instead, paste rich text into a plain text editor first, such as [!DNL Notepad] (Windows) or [!DNL TextEdit] (Mac). Once it's "clean," you can then copy it from the plain text editor and paste it into your email.

   You have three options for inserting an image. Let's look at each.

   **External URL**

   >[!NOTE]

   >If you want to use a Marketo token, use this option. Keep in mind that when you use a token, the image will appear broken in the editor, but will render in Preview mode and the Send Sample email.

   To use an external URL, paste in the image's URL first. Alter the dimensions to suit your needs, and add some [!UICONTROL Alt Text] (optional). Then press **[!UICONTROL Swap]**.
