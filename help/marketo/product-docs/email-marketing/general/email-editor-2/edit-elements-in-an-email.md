   >[!CAUTION]

   >Avoid copying and pasting text from a rich text source, such as a website or a Word document. Instead, paste rich text into a plain text editor first, such as Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). Once it's "clean," you can then copy it from the plain text editor and paste it into your email.
