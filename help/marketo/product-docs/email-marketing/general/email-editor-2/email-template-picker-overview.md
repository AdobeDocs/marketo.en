# Email Template Picker Overview {#email-template-picker-overview}

When you [create an email](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/creating-an-email/create-an-email.md), you have several free templates to choose from. You can also create your own template and save it for future use.

**[!UICONTROL Name]** will be the name of the email you create based off the template, not the template itself. **[!UICONTROL Description]** also applies to the email, and is optional.

If your email is critical and you want it to circumvent Communication Limits, [make it operational](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/functions-in-the-editor/make-an-email-operational.md) by checking the box. **[!UICONTROL Open in editor]** is selected by default, and simply means you want to start editing your new email right away. **[!UICONTROL Create]** means, create!

**[!UICONTROL Starter Templates]** includes a collection of ready-to-go responsive email templates. You may use them as-is, or customize them to your liking.

**[!UICONTROL My Templates]** consists of all the templates you've created. You may also have folders.

>A cool thing about template thumbnails is, they're live. So if you make a change to a template, the thumbnail changes along with it.

Pretty neat!
