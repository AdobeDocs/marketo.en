# Email Template Picker Overview {#email-template-picker-overview}

When you [create an email](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/creating-an-email/create-an-email.md), you have several free templates to choose from. You can also create your own template and save it for future use.

**Name** will be the name of the email you create based off the template, not the template itself. **Description** also applies to the email, and is optional.

If your email is critical and you want it to circumvent Communication Limits, [make it operational](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/functions-in-the-editor/make-an-email-operational.md) by checking the box. **Open in editor** is selected by default, and simply means you want to start editing your new email right away. **Create** means, create!

**Starter Templates** includes a collection of ready-to-go responsive email templates. You may use them as-is, or customize them to your liking.

>Marketo’s Starter Templates are offered to all customers free of charge. While they will be updated continuously and optimized for major email clients (and mobile devices), you should always evaluate whether they satisfy your needs. Marketo’s [Email Deliverability Tool](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/deliverability/email-deliverability-tool.md) can show you renderings of templates on different email clients. Unfortunately, Marketo cannot take design requests outside of paid service engagements.

**My Templates** consists of all the templates you've created. You may also have folders.

All folders that appear under Emails > Templates in your Design Studio tree will be available in **My Templates**.

To preview a template, hover over its thumbnail and click **Preview**. You can also just double-click it.

The previewer shows you how the template will render on a desktop machine...

...and a mobile device.

If you like this template, choose it by clicking **Select** on the bottom right. Wanna keep looking? Click the **X** on the upper right. Use the left and right arrows to scroll through templates.

You can also right-click on a template thumbnail for more options.

>A cool thing about template thumbnails is, they're live. So if you make a change to a template, the thumbnail changes along with it.

Pretty neat!
