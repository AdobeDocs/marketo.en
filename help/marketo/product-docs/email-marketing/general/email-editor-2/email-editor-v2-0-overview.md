# Email Editor v2.0 Overview {#email-editor-v-overview}

When you decide to activate the Email Editor v2.0, you'll notice several new features.

**Email Template Picker**

When you create a new email, you're taken to the [Email Template Picker](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/general/email-editor-2/email-template-picker-overview.md).

**[!UICONTROL Email Actions]**

Under **[!UICONTROL Email Actions]**, you'll notice some new features. **[!UICONTROL Upload an Image or File]**, and **[!UICONTROL Grab Images from Web]**. You can also save the email itself as a new email template. All you have to do is give it a name and a destination.

>[!CAUTION]

>When saving an email as a template, variable values will not carry over. Variables will continue to use the defaults specified in the underlying template. Available modules in the email will also not carry over unless they been inserted into the email body.

>[!NOTE]

>**[[!UICONTROL Grab Images from Web]](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/images-and-files/grab-the-images-from-a-web-page.md)** works just like it does in the [!UICONTROL Design Studio].

**[!UICONTROL Disable Open Tracking]** Under **[!UICONTROL Edit Settings]**, you can disable open tracking if necessary.

**[!UICONTROL Edit Settings]**

You have the option of adding a [!UICONTROL Preheader]. A [!UICONTROL Preheader] is the short summary text after the subject line when emails are viewed in your inbox.

>[!CAUTION]

>Tokens do not work in the [!UICONTROL Preheader] when using the email editor. To use a token in the [!UICONTROL Preheader], it must be via your own HTML in an email template.

Lots of great new features! Have fun!
