   >You can set your cadence to run every day by picking **Repeats: Weekly** / **Every: 1 Week** / **On**: all days.

   Now pick the Time. Check the box if you want to use [Recipient Time Zone](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing/engagement-program-streams/set-stream-cadence/schedule-engagement-programs-with-recipient-time-zone.md)(i.e., deliver according to local time zones), then click **Save**.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >The content will go out on the date you select for the first cast, so make sure it coincides with the day of the week you choose; otherwise it will go out twice in the first week.

1. Hover over the cadence. You'll see what days future casts will go out.

   >[!NOTE]

   >In this example, an email will go out on Thursday. We then skip a week, and send again on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of the following week. And then we loop again.

That's it! Keep reading if you want to setup a monthly cadence.
