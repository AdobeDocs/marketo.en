# Understanding Engagement Programs {#understanding-engagement-programs}

Engagement programs are designed to market to new people by presenting content to them in a systematic way.

>[!NOTE]

>**FYI**

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

>[!NOTE]

>There is a limit of 100 **active** engagement programs per subscription.

## Cast {#cast}

A **cast** is the event of sending emails from an Engagement Program.

>[!NOTE]

>Engagement Programs are not designed to be used with operational emails.

## Stream Cadence {#stream-cadence}

You decide when a cast happens by setting up **stream cadence**. This is how you schedule content to go out at regular intervals.

## Person Cadence {#person-cadence}

A **person cadence** is a status that defines its ability to receive content from an engagement program. You can use the **Change Engagement Program Cadence** flow step to change this to Paused or Normal.

## Exhausted {#exhausted}

Once a person has received every piece of content in a stream, we call the person **Exhausted**.

## Content Engagement Level {#content-engagement-level}

Content Engagement Level is a 0 to 100 point score that Marketo will give your content. This number is determined by a sophisticated formula using opens, clicks, unsubscribes, program success, and other factors.
