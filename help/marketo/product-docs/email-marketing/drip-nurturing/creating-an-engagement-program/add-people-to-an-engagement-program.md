# Add People to an Engagement Program {#add-people-to-an-engagement-program}

There are several ways that people can become members of an engagement program:

* [Add to Engagement Program](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/add-to-engagement-program.md)
* [Change Engagement Program Cadence](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-engagement-program-cadence.md) flow step
* [Change Engagement Program Stream](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-engagement-program-stream.md) flow step
* [Change Program Status](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-program-status.md) flow step
* If a person fills out a form local to an engagement program
* Importing members into an engagement program (via Members tab within program)
* If you are using Salesforce as your CRM and have a Salesforce campaign tied to your engagement program, adding someone to the Salesforce campaign on the CRM side will also make them a member of the engagement program.
