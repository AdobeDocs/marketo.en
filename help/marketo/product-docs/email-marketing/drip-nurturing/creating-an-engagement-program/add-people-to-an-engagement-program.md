# Add People to an Engagement Program {#add-people-to-an-engagement-program}

There are several ways that people can become members of an engagement program:

* [[!UICONTROL Add to Engagement Program]](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/add-to-engagement-program.md)
* [[!UICONTROL Change Engagement Program Cadence]](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-engagement-program-cadence.md) flow step
* [[!UICONTROL Change Engagement Program Stream]](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-engagement-program-stream.md) flow step
* [[!UICONTROL Change Program Status]](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-program-status.md) flow step
* If a person fills out a form local to an engagement program
* Importing members into an engagement program (via Members tab within program)
* If you are using [!DNL Salesforce] as your CRM and have a [!DNL Salesforce] campaign tied to your engagement program, adding someone to the [!DNL Salesforce] campaign on the CRM side will also make them a member of the engagement program.
