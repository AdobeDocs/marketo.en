# Pause People in an Engagement Program {#pause-people-in-an-engagement-program}

When a person is a member of an engagement program, they will receive content until they've [exhausted all content](people-who-have-exhausted-content.md). You can use the [Change Engagement Program Cadence](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-engagement-program-cadence.md) flow step to stop people from receiving content even if they've not yet exhausted content.

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

1. Select the engagement program.

   You can set the person back to **Normal** if you want them to begin receiving content again. They will resume where they left off.

   >Pausing a person will prevent them from receiving content, but they will still transition between streams if they meet the criteria.
