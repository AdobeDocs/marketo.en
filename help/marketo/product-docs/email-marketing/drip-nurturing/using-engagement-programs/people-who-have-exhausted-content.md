# People Who Have Exhausted Content {#people-who-have-exhausted-content}

When a person has received every piece of content in a stream, it has exhausted all possibilities and will wait idle until more is added. You can find people that are "exhausted" in several ways.

## Member of Engagement Program filter {#member-of-engagement-program-filter}
