# Disable and Enable Exhausted Content Notifications {#disable-and-enable-exhausted-content-notifications}

When people exhaust all content in a stream, Marketo can send you a notification. You can disable/enable the notifications based on your needs. Here's how.

1. Go to **Marketing Activities**.
