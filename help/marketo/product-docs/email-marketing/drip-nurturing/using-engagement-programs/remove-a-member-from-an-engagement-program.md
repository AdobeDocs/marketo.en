# Remove a Member from an Engagement Program {#remove-a-member-from-an-engagement-program}

Oops! How did those people get in there? You can remove members from an engagement program with the **Change Program Status** flow step.

>[!NOTE]

>**FYI**

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

>[!TIP]
>
>Don't use this to pause content for a person. That will eliminate all attribution in analytics.  Learn more about how to [pause people in an engagement program](pause-people-in-an-engagement-program.md).

## Flow Step {#flow-step}

1. Drag in the **Change Program Status** flow step.

   Choose the status, **Not in Program**.

   Groovy. All the members you've defined in the [smart list](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/creating-a-smart-list/create-a-smart-list.md) will no longer be in this engagement program.

   ## Pause People  {#pause-people}

   Sometimes you just want to pause people in an engagement program and not remove them. This is done with the **Change Engagement Program Cadence**.
