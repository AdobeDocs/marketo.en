# Archive and Unarchive Stream Content {#archive-and-unarchive-stream-content}

If you no longer want to use a piece of content in a stream you can either [remove](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing/using-stream-content/remove-stream-content.md) it or archive it. Here's how to archive content.
