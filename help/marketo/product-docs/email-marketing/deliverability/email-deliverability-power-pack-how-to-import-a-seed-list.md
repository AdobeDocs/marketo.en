# Email Deliverability Power Pack: How to Import a Seed List {#email-deliverability-power-pack-how-to-import-a-seed-list}

A Seed List is a list of email accounts at multiple mailbox providers, including Google Apps, Hotmail, Yahoo!, etc., that are used to approximate the rate of inbox versus spam folder deliverability. Here’s how to get that list into your Marketo instance.

1. After export, the list will appear as a .txt file in your browser’s downloads folder. Retrieve it, and [import](/help/marketo/getting-started/quick-wins/import-a-list-of-people.md) it into your Marketo instance as a static list.

   >You get a limited amount of these Inbox Placement Campaigns per month. To see how many you get, look at the Subscription section under Account Settings > Subscription in Everest. To obtain more, please contact your Marketo Sales Rep.

## Acquiring New Seedlists {#acquiring-new-seedlists}

   Your Seed List can change as often as every month. It's important to log in to the Email Deliverabilty Power Pack regularly and check the status of your Seed List. When new addresses are added or an update is required on your end, you will be alerted via the Notification Icon on the lower left hand side of the application.

After your static list in Marketo is created, you can begin sending to it to test your email’s inbox placement.
