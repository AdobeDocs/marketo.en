On this panel, you can use the right rail to edit the variables under the respective modules to tune the content.

Change variables. For example: change module background and see the change reflected on the display plane.

To do this,  click on the More button on top to reveal "Save as a fragment".

Select a component or structure and click on Create



Enter a name and save the Fragment.



Recommendations to help adopting your existing templates in the new editor 



The new editor brings a host of powerful features — a true WYSIWYG experience, content governance through locking, brand themes, direct AEM Assets access, image editing with Adobe Express, and advanced personalization using Conditional Content. Best of all, it frees you from coding templates in HTML.

Since freestyle HTML varies widely, the importer may not always interpret every component perfectly. Review your converted templates to ensure all sections are editable and correctly mapped. If any part isn't selectable, simply recreate that section for best results — it's a quick fix that ensures smooth editing for everyone.

After import, save reusable sections as fragments and approve them for use by email authors. Apply brand themes to maintain consistency and compliance.

You can continue using Velocity scripting, and consider reimplementing older snippets using a combination of fragments and conditional content for improved flexibility and control.
