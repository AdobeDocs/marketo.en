    <th>Size and Style setting</th>
    <th>Effect</th>

  <tr>

You can create structures and components in the editor and apply any of the brand themes and their variants.

### In your emails {#in-your-emails}

1. Follow the steps to [create an email](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-designer/email-authoring.md#create-an-email).

1. After creation, click **Edit email content**.

   ![](assets/brand-themes-36.png)

1. Select **Design from scratch**.

   ![](assets/brand-themes-37.png)

1. Select **Use Themes** (it should be selected by default) and click **Confirm**.

   ![](assets/brand-themes-38.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only emails created by this option will be able to leverage the brand themes you defined.

1. Click the _Themes_ icon in the right side bar.

   ![](assets/brand-themes-39.png)

1. Select from Adobe themes or themes you already created.

   ![](assets/brand-themes-40.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* Design email content in the canvas and select a theme to apply to the content.
   >* An email can contain only one brand theme.
   >* For any component created in this asset, you can apply any of the styling options available within the theme from the 'Styles' tab on the right pane (e.g., a call-to-action can be configured as primary/secondary/tertiary).

1. Implement your desired designs. For example, a text component can be selected to apply any of the headings/paragraph styling as defined in the theme.

   ![](assets/brand-themes-41.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The Style tab looks different from a traditional manual styling email where there is more creative liberty to style a component.

### Make a template compatible with themes {#make-a-template-compatible}

1. Find and select the desired template.

1. Click **Edit email template**.

   ![](assets/brand-themes-42.png)

1. Click the _Themes_ icon and click **Generate theme from content**.

   ![](assets/brand-themes-43.png)

1. The _Create a theme_ window opens. Marketo Engage automatically detects the styling elements and consolidates them into a new theme.

   ![](assets/brand-themes-44.png)

1. Name your theme.

1. Make your desired changes (just like you do when creating a theme from scratch). Click **Save** when done.

   ![](assets/brand-themes-45.png)

### In your fragments {#in-your-fragments}

1. Follow the steps to [create a fragment](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/email-designer/fragments.md#create-a-fragment).

1. Design your content theme using the options found in **[Settings](#settings)**.

All fragment content created in the canvas thereafter will adopt the selected theme. You can also apply any variant of a theme to the content.

After your fragment is published, it can be used in any email/email template that is created using themes.

## Things to note {#things-to-note}

* When creating an email from scratch, you can choose to start building your content using a theme to quickly apply a specific styling that fits your brand and design. If you choose the Classic mode, you won't be able to apply any themes unless you reset your email.

* Fragments are not cross-compatible between the Theme and Classic modes. To be able to use a fragment in a content where a theme is applied, it must be created in Theme mode.

* Updating a theme will not automatically cascade to all assets using them. You would need to edit individual objects to refresh the theme.

* When themes are deleted, it does not affect the assets using them.
