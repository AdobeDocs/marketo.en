# Brand themes {#brand-themes}

With brand themes, easily create reusable content that fits a specific brand and design language by adding custom styling to your email templates.

This feature empowers marketers to leverage visually appealing, brand-consistent emails faster and with less effort, while providing advanced customization options for unique design needs.

## Things to note {#things-to-note}

* When creating an email from scratch, you can choose to start building your content using a theme to quickly apply a specific styling that fits your brand and design. If you choose the Classic mode, you won't be able to apply any themes unless you reset your email.

* Fragments are not cross-compatible between the Theme and Classic modes. To be able to use a fragment in a content where a theme is applied, this fragment must be created in Theme mode.

* Updating the themes will not automatically cascade to all assets using them. Users need to edit individual objects to refresh the theme.

* When themes are deleted, it will not affect the assets using them.
