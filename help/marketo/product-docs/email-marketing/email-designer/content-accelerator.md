# Use the AI Assistant Content Accelerator {#use-the-ai-assistant-content-accelerator}

The AI Assistant Content Accelerator is a functionality inside the Marketo Engage Email Designer that helps you create contemporary, performant, and intuitive emails in a productive fashion. This is achieved through Adobe's generative AI technology and prompt library along with Firefly for image generation that aids in creating suitable content for a particular persona/buying group, marketing journey stage, communication strategy, tone, etc. Specific brand assets can be also utilized to create content.

>[!PREREQUISITES]

>The AI Assistant Content Accelerator is not enabled by default. You must first agree to the Core Gen-AI terms and the supplemental terms for using the Gen-AI functionality in the Email Designer. Contact the Adobe Account Team (your account manager) for details.

There are three primary use-cases for the AI Assistant Content Accelerator:

* [Create a subject line](#create-a-subject-line) for your email
* [Create content for a specific section](#create-content-for-a-specific-section) of your email
* [Create an entire email](#create-an-entire-email) from a selected template

## Create a subject line {#create-a-subject-line}

When an email is created using the New Email Designer, enter a temporary subject line.

If you have already used a subject line and wish to use that as a reference for generation, toggle the "Use reference content" button.

Enter the prompt to customize the subject line. Enter relevant text settings and upload any brand assets that you would want to use as a reference to create an appropriate subject line.

    <td>Specific buying group you are targeting (e.g., CEO, Influencer, Decision maker).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Marketing Journey Stage</b></td>
    <td>Recipients in a particular marketing journey stage (e.g., Discover, Evaluate, Commit).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Communication Strategy</b></td>
    <td>The objective of the communication (e.g., Urgent, Social Proof, Informative).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Language</b></td>
    <td>Language in which you want the subject line to be generated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Tone</b></td>
    <td>Tone in which you want the content to be generated (e.g., Inspirational, Exciting, Humorous).</td>
  </tr>

You can also choose to upload a brand asset to use content inside the asset as a reference content to create the subject line.

Once you have selected one variation, you can choose to use it by selecting the variation through the checkbox and clicking Select. You can also choose to refine it by clicking on refine and modify the settings. Also, you can provide feedback through thumbs up or down so that the Gen-AI technology understands what works according to your preferences. 

Upon selecting, you can see the Subject Line gets populated in your Email Details

SCREENSHOT

## Create content for a specific section of your email {#create-content-for-a-specific-section}

Once the email is created through AI Assistant from an email template, you might still want to modify certain portions of the image such as email or text. 

SCREENSHOT

From the previous email that was generated, the image of the healthcare expert is not quite right so you may want to instruct the AI assistant to create an image of a healthcare expert just as a representation, if you do not have an actual image.

In such a case, you may want to select a portion of the email and then use AI assistant to specifically create content for that section. Select the image content and then click the AI assistant.

SCREENSHOT

Enter the relevant details in the prompt such as "generate an image for a healthcare expert" and add any customization, if needed. You can also use the prompt library on the right of the prompt if you are not confident of what prompt to enter.

On clicking "Generate", multiple variants get created and you can choose the one that suits the content of the email.

SCREENSHOT

Similar to image, any other portion of content such as text can be modified as well.

SCREENSHOT

## Create an entire email from a selected template {#create-an-entire-email}

This option is only available if the email is created using an existing template. This can be a Standard Template provided by the Email Designer, Saved Template already created by a marketer or an imported template using Import HTML. Note that this option will not be available if you have chosen to "Design from Scratch" for your email.

On selecting a particular template, without selecting any component within the template, click on the AI assistant button inside the New Email Designer.

SCREENSHOT

Enter the relevant prompt and choose the text settings, brand assets and any image settings that you desire for your email.

SCREENSHOT

If you would like to generate images using Firefly, select the Image Settings and turn the toggle ON for "Generate Images using AI"

SCREENSHOT 

Select the appropriate settings such as Content Type, Color and Tone, Lighting as well as composition to create Gen-AI images for your email. Click on Generate to generate variations of the email.

SCREENSHOT

Select one of the variations to preview by clicking Preview or apply the variation so as to reflect the change on the canvas.
