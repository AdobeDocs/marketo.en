# Use the AI Assistant Content Accelerator {#use-the-ai-assistant-content-accelerator}

Content Accelerator or AI Assistant is a functionality inside the New Email Designer that assists marketers with creating contemporary, performant and intuitive emails in a productive fashion. This is achieved through Adobe's generative AI technology and prompt library along with Firefly for image generation that helps marketers to create suitable content for a particular persona/buying group, marketing journey stage, communication strategy, tone and so on. Specific brand assets can be also used to create content with inputs from these brand assets.

This functionality is enabled only for customers who have signed the Core Gen-AI terms and have been offered the supplemental terms for using the Gen-AI functionality in the New Email Designer. Please contact your account representative to get access to this functionality. This is not available by default with the New Email Designer.

Content Accelerator can be used for 3 primary use-cases:

* Creating a subject line for your email
* Creating an entire email from a selected template
* Creating content for a specific section of your email

## Create a subject line {#creating-a-subject-line}

When an email is created using the New Email Designer, you can enter a temporary subject line.

SCREENSHOT

Once the email has been created, the subject line shall be shown in the Details tab on the right rail. Next to the Subject Line is an AI assistant button that helps the marketers generate the Subject Line using the Gen AI functionality.

On clicking the button, the following screen opens up to provide options to customize the generation of the subject line.

SCREENSHOT

If you have already used a subject line and wish to use that as a reference for generation, toggle the "Use reference content" button.

Enter the prompt to customize the subject line. Enter relevant text settings and upload any brand assets that you would want to use as a reference to create an appropriate subject line.

The text settings include:

<table><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Buying Group</b></td>
    <td>Specific buying group you are targeting such as influencer, decision maker etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Marketing Journey Stage</b></td>
    <td>Recipients in a particular marketing journey stage such as Discover, Evaluate, Commit, etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Communication Strategy</b></td>
    <td>The objective of the communication such as Urgent, Social Proof, Informative and so on</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Language</b></td>
    <td>Language in which you want the subject line to be generated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Tone</b></td>
    <td>Tone in which you want the content to be generated such as Inspirational, Exciting, Humorous and so on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Emojis</b></td>
    <td>Check this toggle if you want emojis to be included in the generation.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A sample filled text setting looks like below:

You can also choose to upload a brand asset to use content inside the asset as a reference content to create the subject line.

Once you have selected one variation, you can choose to use it by selecting the variation through the checkbox and clicking Select. You can also choose to refine it by clicking on refine and modify the settings. Also, you can provide feedback through thumbs up or down so that the Gen-AI technology understands what works according to your preferences. 

Upon selecting, you can see the Subject Line gets populated in your Email Details

SCREENSHOT

## Create an entire email from a selected template {#create-an-entire-email}

This option is only available if the email is created using an existing template. This can be a Standard Template provided by the Email Designer, Saved Template already created by a marketer or an imported template using Import HTML. Note that this option will not be available if you have chosen to "Design from Scratch" for your email.

On selecting a particular template, without selecting any component within the template, click on the AI assistant button inside the New Email Designer.

SCREENSHOT

Enter the relevant prompt and choose the text settings, brand assets and any image settings that you desire for your email.

SCREENSHOT

If you would like to generate images using Firefly, select the Image Settings and turn the toggle ON for "Generate Images using AI"

SCREENSHOT 

Select the appropriate settings such as Content Type, Color and Tone, Lighting as well as composition to create Gen-AI images for your email. Click on Generate to generate variations of the email.

SCREENSHOT

Select one of the variations to preview by clicking Preview or apply the variation so as to reflect the change on the canvas.


## Create content for specific section of your email {#create-content-for-a-specific-section}

Once the email is created through AI Assistant from an email template, you might still want to modify certain portions of the image such as email or text. 

SCREENSHOT

From the previous email that was generated, the image of the healthcare expert is not quite right so you may want to instruct the AI assistant to create an image of a healthcare expert just as a representation, if you do not have an actual image.

In such a case, you may want to select a portion of the email and then use AI assistant to specifically create content for that section. Select the image content and then click the AI assistant.

SCREENSHOT

Enter the relevant details in the prompt such as "generate an image for a healthcare expert" and add any customization, if needed. You can also use the prompt library on the right of the prompt if you are not confident of what prompt to enter.

On clicking "Generate", multiple variants get created and you can choose the one that suits the content of the email.

SCREENSHOT

Similar to image, any other portion of content such as text can be modified as well.
