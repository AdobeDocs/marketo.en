# Edit images with Adobe Express {#edit-images-with-adobe-express}

Adobe Marketo Engage integrates natively with Adobe Express, giving you access to a variety of image editing tools. You can use these tools to modify your images in the Marketo Engage Design Studio. The integration provides the following key benefits:

* Increased content reuse by editing and saving new images in Marketo Engage.

* Reduced time and effort in updating images or creating new versions of existing images.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Express only supports PNG and JPEG image file formats at this time.

## Adobe Express Enterprise license {#adobe-express-enterprise-license}

### Users with an Enterprise license {#users-with-an-enterprise-license}

If you have an Enterprise license for Adobe Express, you have access to the full Express editor. You can adjust image settings like color, brightness, sharpness, contrast, size, and more. The AI Magic option allows you to remove backgrounds, insert and remove objects, and erase parts of an image. Visit the [Adobe Express User Guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/express/user-guide.html){target="_blank"} to learn about each setting.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The license purchased must be under the same IMS Org as your Marketo Engage subscription to access all Adobe Express editing capabilities. Also, each individual user must have a license in Adobe Express. Users [without a license](#users-without-an-enterprise-license) can only access the quick actions in Adobe Express.

### Users without an Enterprise license {#users-without-an-enterprise-license}

For those without an Enterprise license, you still have access to several quick action editing features. Those features are:

* [Resize image](#resize-image)
* [Remove background](#remove-background)
* [Crop image](#crop-image)
* [Convert to PNG/JPEG](#convert-to-png-jpeg)

The features are accessible on the left side of the image page.
