# Edit images with Adobe Express {#edit-images-with-adobe-express}

Adobe Marketo Engage integrates natively with Adobe Express, giving you access to a variety of image editing tools. You can use these tools to modify your images in the Marketo Engage Design Studio. The integration provides the following key benefits:

* Increased content reuse by editing and saving new images in Marketo Engage.

* Reduced time and effort in updating images or creating new versions of existing images.

>Adobe Express only supports PNG and JPEG image file formats at this time.
