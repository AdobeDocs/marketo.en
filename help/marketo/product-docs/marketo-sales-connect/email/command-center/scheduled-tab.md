# Scheduled Tab {#scheduled-tab}

The Scheduled tab in the Command Center is where you go to check any scheduled emails that are queued for a later date.

I `f you scheduled an email to go out at a later date` and need to `edit or` `delete it, t`he Scheduled tab would be the place to do so.

This Scheduled tab is also where your [Campaign follow-ups](http://docs.marketo.com/x/NCDG) are stored until they're ready to be sent. So, if you used a campaign with three steps, after you send the first one, the second scheduled email will appear. After the second is sent, the third will appear.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Scheduled emails will be bubbled up to the Command Center homepage.
