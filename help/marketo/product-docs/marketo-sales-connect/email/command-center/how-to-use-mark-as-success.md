# How to Use Mark as Success {#how-to-use-mark-as-success}

We let our users determine what they deem as "success" based on their workflow needs. Everyone has their own definition of success, which is why we leave this option up to our users.

#### Mark an Email as a Success {#mark-an-email-as-a-success}

1. Locate the specific email you'd like to mark.
1. Double-click the email to open up the contact details pane.
1. Click the **Success** button above the email.

#### Why This Metric Is Important {#why-this-metric-is-important}

This metric gets aggregated into the analytics page, and also gets tracked in the template analytics for any template you use.

Using the Success button is a great way to keep tabs on the consistent messaging that's working for you so you can share it with your team members. When you pull in a template in the compose screen, we'll automatically show you a quick view of the success rate for the template.
