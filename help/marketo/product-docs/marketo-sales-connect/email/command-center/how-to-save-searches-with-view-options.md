# How to Save Searches with View Options {#how-to-save-searches-with-view-options}

View Options gives you the ability to filter your emails. If you plan on looking at the same View Options results day-to-day, you can set up a saved search.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Example**
>
>All users who have clicked on your email over the past seven days. You know this is the first thing you're going to look at every morning. Instead of setting this up every time, you can have it just a click away.
