# Throttling Error Message in a Failed Delivery {#throttling-error-message-in-a-failed-delivery}

If you're sending through your own server, it's going to have limitations for the number of emails you can send simultaneously. When sending through Sales Connect, you have the ability to send many emails, but we try to send them at the same time. So if you are aware that your server is going to cut you off at 100 emails per minute, you need to only send 100 emails through the [web application](http://toutapp.com/login) at once. Otherwise the emails can land in your "Failed Delivery" folder, because they're being throttled by your email delivery provider.
