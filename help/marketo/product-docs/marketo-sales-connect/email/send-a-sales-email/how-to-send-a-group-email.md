# How to Send a Group Email {#how-to-send-a-group-email}

Sending a group email with Sales Connect enables you to contact multiple recipients at once with the same message. This eliminates the tedious task of copying and pasting the same information over and over into multiple emails.

>Group email recipients each receive their own personalized message. We also deliver individual tracking statistics for each recipient.
