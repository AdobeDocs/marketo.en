#### How Does Sales Connect Handle a Hard Bounce? {#how-does-sales-connect-handle-a-hard-bounce}

- If emails are going through ToutApp servers, we manage hard bounces.

- If emails are going through your own servers, check with your SMTP provider. In this case, Sales Connect isn't notified about hard bounces.

Clicking the email will give you more details about why it bounced.
