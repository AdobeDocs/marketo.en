# Sending File Attachments in Your Email {#sending-file-attachments-in-your-email}

Sending an attachment is a great way to keep your email short and let your marketing team do the talking. However, sending an email with a large file could prevent your recipient from it.

Typically, any file over 20MB will be too large to be delivered. The size of an attachment you can send via email varies depending on the email delivery channel you're using.

>[!TIP]
>
>When using Tout as your email delivery channel, we recommend files of 19MB or less when sending emails.

If you absolutely need to send a large file, try zipping it first or upload it as a [trackable attachment](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/email/common-tracking-questions/how-to-track-your-email-attachments.md) in the [web application](https://toutapp.com/login).
