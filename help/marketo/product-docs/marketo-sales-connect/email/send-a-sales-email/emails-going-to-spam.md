# Emails Going to Spam {#emails-going-to-spam}

We work very hard to ensure that our deliverability rates remain high. Still, there are certain user behaviors that can get emails routed to the Spam folder.
  
Here's what we recommend:

1. Keep your emails short and informal, paste your templates as an email you've written before.

1. Make sure you have a fully completed email signature with a physical address.

1. Use Google or Outlook to send your emails, or set up an SMTP to deliver messages through your own servers.
