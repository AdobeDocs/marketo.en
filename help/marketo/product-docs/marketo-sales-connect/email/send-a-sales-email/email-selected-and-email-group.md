# Email Selected and Email Group {#email-selected-and-email-group}

Once a group is created and contacts are added, you have two options when sending a targeted group email.

## Email Selected {#email-selected}

Using email selected, you can `select specific recipients in the group` that you want to contact. This method also `allows you to edit each email before they get sent out`.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This method is recommended if you're looking to email around 15 recipients or less and would like to edit each email.

You can `add specific content` relevant to each recipient before the group email gets sent out.  

## Email Entire Group {#email-entire-group}

We also give you the option to send an email to everyone in this group and have this personalized information fill out for each recipient.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This method is recommended when you're conducting larger group sends.

In the group, select **Email Group**. It will `pull in everyone in the group for you to email`.  Here you can use a designated template and select preview to get a glimpse of how the email is going to look before it gets sent. Once everything looks good, just hit send!
