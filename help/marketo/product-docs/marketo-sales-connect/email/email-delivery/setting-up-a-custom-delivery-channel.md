# Setting up a Custom Delivery Channel {#setting-up-a-custom-delivery-channel}

[!DNL Marketo Sales Connect] allows you to integrate with a custom SMTP server for the delivery of your emails. This is a great option for those who don't want to send bulk emails out of their Gmail or [!DNL Exchange] delivery channel.

Users can set up a custom SMTP server for their own individual usage, or Admins can set up a Team SMTP to be shared across all [!DNL Sales Connect] users in your instance.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* In addition to setting up your SMTP server, your [email identity has to be verified](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/getting-started/email-settings/verify-your-email.md) before you can send emails.
>* We recommend working with your IT team or SMTP server vendor to get the right server credentials for your SMTP server.
>* You cannot connect your Gmail and [!DNL Exchange] server using the SMTP server credentials. Please use our Email Connection service to integrate with these providers.
