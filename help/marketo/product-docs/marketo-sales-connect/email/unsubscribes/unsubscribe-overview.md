# Unsubscribe Overview {#unsubscribe-overview}

It is becoming increasingly important for organizations to be in compliance with email privacy laws. To help with this, we have made some enhancements to our unsubscribe experience.

* Unsubscribe links are placed on all emails sent from Sales Connect/ToutApp and Salesforce (this does not apply to custom emails sent from Outlook or Gmail)
* Admins can edit unsubscribe messaging for their entire team
* Unsubscribe information is stored in PDV
* Unsubscribes can be done manually: Clicked Link, Salesforce Sync, and Bounce
* New unsubscribe link landing page
