# Unsubscribe Overview {#unsubscribe-overview}

It is becoming increasingly important for organizations to be in compliance with email privacy laws. To help with this, we have made some enhancements to our unsubscribe experience.

* Unsubscribe links are placed on all emails sent from [!DNL Sales Connect]/ToutApp and [!DNL Salesforce] (this does not apply to custom emails sent from [!DNL Outlook] or Gmail)
* Admins can edit unsubscribe messaging for their entire team
* Unsubscribe information is stored in PDV
* Unsubscribes can be done manually: Clicked Link, [!DNL Salesforce] Sync, and Bounce
* New unsubscribe link landing page
