>If you have the unsubscribe sync turned on, you must uncheck the opt out box on the record in Salesforce as well or the nightly sync will re-unsubscribe the person in [!DNL Sales Connect], as it will detect the person is opted out in [!DNL Salesforce]. If either of the records are opt out/unsubscribed, the sync will mark the linked record as such.
