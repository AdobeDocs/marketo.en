# How Reply Tracking Works {#how-reply-tracking-works}

Reply Tracking is done by looking at a message ID that's in every email you send. Every email contains a unique message ID that allows us to have some of the best reply tracking around.

>**Connection with Email Server:** [!DNL Sales Connect] must be connected with your inbox so we know when a new reply has arrived. You'll need to have your [!DNL Sales Connect] account [connected to Gmail](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/email-plugins/gmail/email-connection-for-gmail-users.md). If you're using [!DNL Outlook], we'll need to integrate with your [exchange server](https://toutapp.com/next#settings/exchange_settings).

If [!DNL Sales Connect] can't track your prospect's reply to your email, it won't be able to stop a campaign based on reply detection or log that reply to [!DNL Salesforce].  What do we mean any email address can reply?

This means that if you email <flynn@flynnsarcade.com> and he responds with <kevinf@flynnsarcade.com>, we're able to track the reply. Additionally, if you email <flynn@flynnsarcade.com> and CC <alan@encom.com>, and Alan writes you back, it will also detect the reply and end the campaign.
