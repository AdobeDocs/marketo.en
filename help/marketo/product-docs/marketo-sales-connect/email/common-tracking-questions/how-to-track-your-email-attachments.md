# How to Track Your Email Attachments {#how-to-track-your-email-attachments}

Sales Connect offers tracking on your attachments (.doc, .ppt, .pdf) so you can see when they've been `opened/` `downloaded`, and `see what pages your recipient is looking through`. We'll allow you to use our trackable attachments feature from both the [web application](http://toutapp.com/login) and Gmail (or Google Apps).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Attachment tracking is only available for our team plans (starting with our g3startup plan).

## How to Send Your First Trackable Attachment {#how-to-send-your-first-trackable-attachment}

1. Upload your attachment and send it out. We support PDFs, Word docs, and Powerpoint presentations.
1. Select **Add to Email**.
1. Click **Send** and fire up your Live Feed. You'll see your recipients as they open and page through your attachments.* *
