# Add an Attachment or Trackable Content to Your Email {#add-an-attachment-or-trackable-content-to-your-email}

When sending an email through Sales Connect, you have the option of adding a file as an attachment, or making a file a downloadable (and trackable) link.

>Typically, any file over 20MB will be too large to be delivered. The size of an attachment you can send via email varies depending on the email delivery channel youâ€™re using.
