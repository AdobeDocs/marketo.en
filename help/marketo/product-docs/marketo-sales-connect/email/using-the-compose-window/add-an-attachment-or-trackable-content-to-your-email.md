# Add an Attachment or Trackable Content to Your Email {#add-an-attachment-or-trackable-content-to-your-email}

When sending an email through [!DNL Sales Connect], you have the option of adding a file as an attachment, or making a file a downloadable (and trackable) link.

>[!NOTE]

>Typically, any file over 20MB will be too large to be delivered. The size of an attachment you can send via email varies depending on the email delivery channel youâ€™re using.

## Add an Attachment {#add-an-attachment}

1. Create your email draft (there are multiple ways to do this, in this example we're choosing **[!UICONTROL Compose]** in the header).
