# Sending a Tracked Email {#sending-a-tracked-email}

When sending an email with [!DNL Marketo Sales Connect], views (email opens) and clicks (clicked links) will be tracked.

>You'll need to have an identity verified and an email delivery channel set up before sending a tracked email.

1. Create your email draft (there are multiple ways to do this, in this example we're choosing **[!UICONTROL Compose]** in the header).
