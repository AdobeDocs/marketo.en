1. Create your email draft (there are multiple ways to do this, in this example we're choosing **Compose** in the header).

   >If someone who's been CC’d or BCC’d opens the email, that open will be recorded as a view on the record of the person in the **To** field.

1. Add a subject line.

   >A subject line and recipient is required to send the email. We will **automatically save your draft** once a subject line and recipient have been added.

1. Compose your email using the editor. Click **Send** (or [Schedule](http://docs.marketo.com/x/GAQ6Ag), if you prefer) when done.
