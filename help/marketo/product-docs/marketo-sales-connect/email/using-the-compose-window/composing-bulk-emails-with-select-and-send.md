   >[!NOTE]

   >If you selected a template and would like to check that all of the dynamic fields are populating correctly before sending, click **[!UICONTROL Preview Dynamic Fields]**. Ensure all recipients in the bulk sidebar are selected to preview for all emails. If you select one email and click **[!UICONTROL Preview Dynamic Fields]**, only that email will be previewed.

## Editing Emails {#editing-emails}

**Bulk Edits**

1. Follow Steps 1-3 from the [Sending Emails section](#sending-emails).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >All of the recipients will be selected by default. If you click on an individual and want to re-select everyone, click **All Recipients**. As a reminder, all of the recipients must be selected in order to make bulk edits.

1. Make your changes in the editor. You can create a new email or edit a template (in this example we're creating a new email).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can click on a specific email recipient to see the changes propagated to that email.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Send]** (or [[!UICONTROL Schedule]](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/email/using-the-compose-window/scheduling-an-email.md)) to send to all recipients with the bulk email updates you made.

**Edit Each Email**

Complete Bulk Updates before customizing each email, as making a bulk update overwrites changes to every email in the bulk compose sidebar.

1. Follow Steps 1-4 from the [Sending Emails section](#sending-emails).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >All of the recipients will be selected by default. If you click on an individual and want to re-select everyone, click **All Recipients**. As a reminder, all of the recipients must be selected in order to make bulk edits.

1. Select an individual recipient.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >This is where you can make edits to a single email in the bulk sidebar without updating the rest of the emails.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can click on other recipients to see that the changes you made to the previously selected recipient are not showing.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Send]** (or [[!UICONTROL Schedule]](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/email/using-the-compose-window/scheduling-an-email.md)) to send to all recipients with the bulk email updates you made.
