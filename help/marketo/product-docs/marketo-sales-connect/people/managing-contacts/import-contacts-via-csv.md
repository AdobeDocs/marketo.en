# Import Contacts via CSV {#import-contacts-via-csv}

Having contacts in the [!UICONTROL People] page is important because it's where we pull from to auto-fill personalized information in the dynamic fields in your templates. Make sure you have at least a name and an email address for each contact in your CSV and that you map to those fields.

1. Select your group (or create a new one) in the [!UICONTROL People] tab.
