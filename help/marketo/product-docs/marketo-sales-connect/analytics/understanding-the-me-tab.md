# Understanding the Me Tab {#understanding-the-me-tab}

In the Me Tab we show you the number of emails sent, as well as how many emails were sent using a template with the emailing activity.

We also show you the list of who's been spending the most time trying to engage with you, and a list of your most engaging emails sorted by total number of tracked events (views/clicks/replies). Have a one-off email getting really high engagement? Make it a template!
