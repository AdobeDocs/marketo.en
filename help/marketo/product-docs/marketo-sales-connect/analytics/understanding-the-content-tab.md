# Understanding the Content Tab {#understanding-the-content-tab}

The Content Tab is all about your team's email engagement when using a template. We automatically bubble up three metrics that we believe to be important.

## Secret weapon {#secret-weapon}

This is an email template that has not yet been shared with the team, but is receiving a high level of engagement. We show you the template subject line and the creator of the template. This is a great opportunity to reach out to this rep and recommend that he/she share the template!

## Highest engagement {#highest-engagement}

This is the shared template that is getting the highest level of engagement across the board.

## Lowest engagement {#lowest-engagement}

Can be shared or not shared, this is the template with the least amount of engagement.

Scroll down the page to see the Templates section that shows all the templates your team has been using (in this time frame) with the most views*.*

You can also see the Top Attachments that your team has sent (getting the most views), and the Top Links (getting the most clicks).
