# Log Call Reasons and Call Outcomes to Salesforce {#log-call-reasons-and-call-outcomes-to-salesforce}

If you'd like to log call outcomes and call reasons to Salesforce for reporting or visibility purposes, you can create a custom activity field for each. Each field must use a specific API name.

* Call Outcomes API Name: mktosales_call_outcome
* Call Reasons API Name: mktosales_call_reason

To utilize these fields, you'll first need to create the field as a custom activity field. In order to make it visible to users, you'll need to add it to the task object page layout.
