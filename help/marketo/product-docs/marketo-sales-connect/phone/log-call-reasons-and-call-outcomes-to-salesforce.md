# Log Call Reasons and Call Outcomes to [!DNL Salesforce] {#log-call-reasons-and-call-outcomes-to-salesforce}

If you'd like to log call outcomes and call reasons to [!DNL Salesforce] for reporting or visibility purposes, you can create a custom activity field for each. Each field must use a specific API Name (known as "Field Name" in [!DNL Salesforce]).

* Call Outcomes Field Name: mktosales_call_outcome
* Call Reasons Field Name: mktosales_call_reason

To utilize these fields, you'll first need to create the field as a custom activity field. In order to make it visible to users, you'll need to add it to the task object page layout.
