# Calls Aren't Logging to [!DNL Salesforce] {#calls-arent-logging-to-salesforce}

If you want your calls from Sales Phone to be automatically logged to [!DNL Salesforce], make sure the following is in place.

You will need your [!DNL Sales Connect] account to be connected to your [[!DNL Salesforce] account](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/crm/salesforce-integration/connect-your-sales-connect-account-to-salesforce.md) through the API connection.

If you are calling from the [web application](https://toutapp.com/login), you will need a [!DNL Salesforce] ID saved to that contact. [Click here](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/crm/salesforce-customization/import-a-salesforce-id-into-sales-connect.md) to see how you can ensure that all of your [!DNL Sales Connect] contacts have a [!DNL Salesforce] ID associated with them.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Make sure you have "Call" in your Task type picklist for accurate and easy reporting in [!DNL Salesforce].

Once this is in place you will see a Task created in the Activity History section of [!DNL Salesforce].
