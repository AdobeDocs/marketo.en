# Calls Aren't Logging to Salesforce {#calls-arent-logging-to-salesforce}

If you want your calls from Sales Phone to be automatically logged to Salesforce, make sure the following is in place.

You will need your Sales Connect account to be connected to your [Salesforce account](http://docs.marketo.com/x/q4LS) through the API connection.

If you are calling from the [web application](http://toutapp.com/login), you will need a Salesforce ID saved to that contact. [Click here](http://docs.marketo.com/x/G4PS) to see how you can ensure that all of your Sales Connect contacts have a Salesforce ID associated with them.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Make sure you have "Call" in your Task type picklist for accurate and easy reporting in Salesforce.

Once this is in place you will see a Task created in the Activity History section of Salesforce.
