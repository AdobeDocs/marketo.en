# Didn't Log to Salesforce {#didnt-log-to-salesforce}

If you aren't seeing your calls log to Salesforce, it might be because we cannot locate a Lead/Contact in Salesforce.  
  
For calls to log to the correct Lead/Contact, Sales Connect needs to have the Salesforce ID. The best way to add the Salesforce ID to Sales Connect is by using our [Push to Sales Connect](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/crm/salesforce-customization/push-to-sales-connect.md) feature. When you use Push to Sales Connect we include the Salesforce ID in the contact migration.
