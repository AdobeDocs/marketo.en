# Didn't Log to [!DNL Salesforce] {#didnt-log-to-salesforce}

If you aren't seeing your calls log to [!DNL Salesforce], it might be because we cannot locate a Lead/Contact in [!DNL Salesforce].

For calls to log to the correct Lead/Contact, [!DNL Sales Connect] needs to have the [!DNL Salesforce] ID. The best way to add the [!DNL Salesforce] ID to [!DNL Sales Connect] is by using our [Push to [!DNL Sales Connect]](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/crm/salesforce-customization/push-to-sales-connect.md) feature. When you use Push to [!DNL Sales Connect] we include the [!DNL Salesforce] ID in the contact migration.
