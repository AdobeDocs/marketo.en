# Why Aren't Any of My Contacts Getting Pushed to [!DNL Sales Connect]? {#why-arent-any-of-my-contacts-getting-pushed-to-sales-connect}

If no contacts were pushed over, it's possible you have an invalid [!DNL Salesforce] connection. Go to your [[!DNL Salesforce] settings](https://toutapp.com/login) and disconnect then reconnect. Give it about 20 minutes to fully reset. If it's still zero after that, please [submit a case](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/Support/ct-p/Support#) to Support.
