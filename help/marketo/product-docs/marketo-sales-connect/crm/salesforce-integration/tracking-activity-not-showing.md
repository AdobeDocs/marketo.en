# Tracking Activity Not Showing {#tracking-activity-not-showing}

If your tracking activity isn't showing, make sure the custom activity fields that Sales Connect provides are visible/editable in Salesforce. If you've installed the fields but they are not populating, there might be Field-Level Security preventing information from populating. Please check with your Salesforce Admin.

Learn more about [Field-Level Security](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=admin_fls.htm&type=5) in Salesforce.
