# Sales Connect Customizations for CRM {#sales-connect-customizations-for-crm}

The fields and buttons below are created by the Metadata API in Salesforce CRM. Once the fields are created, admins must configure the page layouts in their CRM to expose them. Instructions can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tout-user-store/salesforce/assets/Marketo+Sales+Engage+For+Salesforce_+Installation+and+Success+Guide.pdf).

## Custom Activity Fields {#custom-activity-fields}

Marketo will detect the creation of the new fields then do a one-time backfill of data, a re-mapping, and an ongoing sync of values into the **new** fields only. Old fields will not be updated.
