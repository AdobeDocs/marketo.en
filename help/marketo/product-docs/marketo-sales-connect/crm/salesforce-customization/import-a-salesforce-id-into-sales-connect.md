# Import a Salesforce ID into Sales Connect {#import-a-salesforce-id-into-sales-connect}

Sales Connect uses the Contact or Lead ID (also known as Salesforce ID), to help log information properly to Salesforce. There are a few ways that you can attach your Salesforce ID to your contacts in Sales Connect.

##### [Push to Sales Connect](http://docs.marketo.com/x/F4PS): Using Push to Sales Connect will create a contact in Sales Connect with all the key contact information, including the lead/contact's Salesforce ID. {#push-to-sales-connect-using-push-to-sales-connect-will-create-a-contact-in-sales-connect-with-all-the-key-contact-information-including-the-lead-contacts-salesforce-id}

##### [Send Marketo Sales Email, Add to Campaign, and Click to Call Buttons in SFDC](http://docs.marketo.com/x/DYPS): When you use any of these three buttons in Salesforce, we will push the contact to Sales Connect with the Salesforce ID. {#send-marketo-sales-email-add-to-campaign-and-click-to-call-buttons-in-sfdc-when-you-use-any-of-these-three-buttons-in-salesforce-we-will-push-the-contact-to-sales-connect-with-the-salesforce-id}

##### [Import CSV](http://docs.marketo.com/x/HIPS): If you export a list of leads/contacts from Salesforce and you include a column with the Salesforce ID, you can map the field to Sales Connect on import. {#import-csv-if-you-export-a-list-of-leads-contacts-from-salesforce-and-you-include-a-column-with-the-salesforce-id-you-can-map-the-field-to-sales-connect-on-import}
