   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you're already on the list you'll be using, you'll have to execute it again by choosing it from the drop-down in order to make sure the MSC bulk action buttons show up. This is [!DNL Salesforce] behavior that cannot be changed.

1. Click the arrow drop-down (on the far right of the screen) and select **[!UICONTROL Email with MSC]**.

   a. "[!UICONTROL To]" field shows "All receipts" - this corresponds to the list of leads you have chosen in the Lead List View
   b. This list is visible on the left panel called "Bulk compose" - you can add/remove recipients here
   c. You can choose a template or create your own email
   d. You can send the email right away or schedule to send it at a later time
