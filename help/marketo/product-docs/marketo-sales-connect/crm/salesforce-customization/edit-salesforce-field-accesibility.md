# Edit Salesforce Field Accesibility {#edit-salesforce-field-accesibility}

If you are not seeing email activity log to [!DNL Salesforce], it might be due to restrictions on your team's Field Accessibility.

* Salesforce's Field Level security gives [!DNL Salesforce] admins the ability to put restrictions around what information is viewable and editable by users. When setting field level security, make sure it's not interfering with the ability for users to see [!DNL Sales Connect] fields.

* Work with your [!DNL Salesforce] Admin to ensure these security settings are not interfering with [!DNL Sales Connect].

* If you are a [!DNL Salesforce] admin, you can see your Field Accessibility under the [!UICONTROL Security Controls] tab. The main fields that [!DNL Sales Connect] will interact with are: [!UICONTROL Account], [!UICONTROL Contacts], [!UICONTROL Opportunity], [!UICONTROL Lead], and [!UICONTROL Task].
