# Edit Salesforce Field Accesibility {#edit-salesforce-field-accesibility}

If you are not seeing email activity log to Salesforce, it might be due to restrictions on your team's Field Accessibility.

* Salesforce's Field Level security gives Salesforce admins the ability to put restrictions around what information is viewable and editable by users. When setting field level security, make sure it's not interfering with the ability for users to see Sales Connect fields.

* Work with your Salesforce Admin to ensure these security settings are not interfering with Sales Connect.

* If you are a Salesforce admin, you can see your Field Accessibility under the Security Controls tab. The main fields that Sales Connect will interact with are: Account, Contacts, Opportunity, Lead, and Task.
