# Create a Salesforce Priority Call Report with Sales Connect Data {#create-a-salesforce-priority-call-report-with-sales-connect-data}

Learn how to create a [!DNL Salesforce] report/call list using [!DNL Sales Connect] email engagement data to focus on the people or opportunities with momentum.

1. Go to the [!UICONTROL SFDC Report] Tab.
1. Create a Report with "[!UICONTROL Tasks and Events]".
1. Set your filters and choose a date range.
1. Drag [!DNL Sales Connect] data into your columns by typing "Marketo Sales" into the field search. Once you add [!DNL Sales Connect] data, add a column for Phone Number so you can take action on this report and use it as a call list.
1. Run the report and sort by [!UICONTROL Sales Connect Events Tracked]. This will bubble up the people with the most activity on your emails. Make sure you either have the next steps planned with these top people or make them a priority that day. There is likely momentum with a high number.
