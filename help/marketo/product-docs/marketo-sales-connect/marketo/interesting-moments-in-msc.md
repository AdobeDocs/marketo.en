## What is an interesting moment?  {#what-is-an-interesting-moment}

That's up to you! You decide what information is relevant to your sales team. Your sales team might want to know when a lead:

* Visits the pricing page on your website
* Clicks a link in a new product announcement email
* Requests a product demo

## How do I create an interesting moment? {#how-do-i-create-an-interesting-moment}

1. Choose a  [s](../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/understanding-smart-campaigns.md) [mart campaign](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/smart+campaigns), preferably one your sales team would find interesting if triggered.

Interesting Moments will be displayed in real time in a user's Live Feed. We utilize the lead owner ID in Salesforce to show users' interesting moments of relevant leads that they're the owner of. Users can quickly follow up with leads via email/phone/sales campaign by clicking the drop-down next to the lead's name.
