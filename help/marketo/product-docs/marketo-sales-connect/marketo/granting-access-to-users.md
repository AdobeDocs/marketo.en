# Granting Access to Users {#granting-access-to-users}

Follow the steps in this article to grant your Sales Connect users access to the Marketo connection. This will unlock features such as Interesting Moments in the Live Feed and access to Marketing Campaigns.

You will need to invite users to Sales Connect here, before they are visible in the Marketo – Team Access page, where access to the Marketo connection is granted.

>[!CAUTION]

>Please wait ten minutes after connecting Sales Connect with Marketo before performing these steps.

1. Select one or more users, then click **Connect**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can only do the workspace assignment once at the time of inviting users. After it's set, you'll have to disconnect the user in order to change it.
