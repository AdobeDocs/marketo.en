# Set up Your Marketo Connection {#set-up-your-marketo-connection}

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you provision MSC, Marketo will automatically send your credentials to [!DNL Sales Connect] and connect your instance to Marketo. This step is required **only if you are not seeing the connection established** after your [!DNL Sales Connect] instance is provisioned. If your connection is established you will see your credentials entered on the Marketo Admin Settings page.

You'll need to get a set of credentials from within Marketo. These credentials will be used later by the [!DNL Sales Connect] Admin to connect Marketo with [!DNL Sales Connect].
