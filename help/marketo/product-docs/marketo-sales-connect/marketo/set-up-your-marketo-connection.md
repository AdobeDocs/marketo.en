>When you provision MSC, Marketo will automatically send your credentials to Sales Connect and connect your instance to Marketo. This step is required **only if you are not seeing the connection established** after your Sales Connect instance is provisioned. If your connection is established you will see your credentials entered on the Marketo Admin Settings page.
