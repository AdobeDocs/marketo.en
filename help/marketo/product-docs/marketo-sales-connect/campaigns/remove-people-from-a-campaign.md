# Remove People from a Campaign {#remove-people-from-a-campaign}

You can automatically end a Campaign when a recipient replies. And, you can choose to have that mark the Campaign as a 'success' for that recipient.

To set this up, after you have created your campaign, simply check the [!UICONTROL Unsubscribe] boxes in the [!UICONTROL Settings] portion of the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] tab. Both of these options will end the campaign and your recipient will not receive any more emails from you. You must have reply tracking for this to work.

Additionally, you can remove people from the campaign itself, remove people from a campaign within the People page, and remove an entire group of people. Let's take a look at all three methods below.

## Remove a Person Directly from a Campaign {#remove-a-person-directly-from-a-campaign}
