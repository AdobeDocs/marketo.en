#### Turn off a Campaign for One Person {#turn-off-a-campaign-for-one-person}

After you've created your campaign, simply go to the **Settings** tab and choose how you'd like the campaign to behave if someone replies.

Both of the options will end the campaign, and the recipient will not receive any more emails from you.

#### Turn off a Campaign for Multiple People {#turn-off-a-campaign-for-multiple-people}

In your sent folder, select contacts to remove them from the campaign with the filter set to "All" to capture anyone who has received a campaign.

Or, you can go directly to the Campaign they are on and remove them in bulk.
