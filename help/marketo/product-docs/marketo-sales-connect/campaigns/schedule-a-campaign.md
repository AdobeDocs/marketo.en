# Schedule a Campaign {#schedule-a-campaign}

You can either schedule each individual email step of your Campaign to go out at a specific time, or choose each subsequent email step to go out at the same time as the first email in your Campaign.

All you need to do is choose when you'd like your emails to be sent when you create your Campaign.

If you didn't schedule your first step or need to choose a "[!UICONTROL Send at]" time, you will be asked to choose when your Campaign should be sent, each time you add a person or a group.

Open up the [!UICONTROL Add to Campaign] modal, either by adding individuals, a group, or selected people and click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

After you click **[!UICONTROL Next]**, you can preview the first email.

After clicking **[!UICONTROL Next]** again, you'll be taken to an option for when you want your campaign to go out. You can either have it start now, or schedule a time for later to begin the campaign.
