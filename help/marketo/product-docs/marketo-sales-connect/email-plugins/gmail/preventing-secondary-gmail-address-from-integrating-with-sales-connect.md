# Preventing Secondary Gmail Address from Integrating with [!DNL Sales Connect] {#preventing-secondary-gmail-address-from-integrating-with-sales-connect}

## Broken Gmail Integration (why is my personal Gmail sending emails) {#broken-gmail-integration-why-is-my-personal-gmail-sending-emails}

The most common reason for a broken Gmail connection is an accidental integration with a user's personal account. This can happen when a user clicks “Connect” or when they try to send an email from their personal account. This can be very tempting to do because the option will exist when accessing your Gmail account in the same instance of [!DNL Chrome ]as your work email.

## Why does [!DNL Sales Connect] even try to integrate with my personal Gmail? {#why-does-sales-connect-even-try-to-integrate-with-my-personal-gmail}

[!DNL Sales Connect] integrates with Gmail through an extension installed in the [!DNL Chrome ]browser. Whenever the extension senses an instance of Gmail open, it offers an option to integrate with it. To prevent an integration with your personal Gmail account, we recommend one of three things...

Sign In As Another [!DNL Chrome ]User (Recommended)

Click [this link](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en) to read how to create another [!DNL Chrome ]Profile.

**Pros**: Signing in as another user will open a new instance of [!DNL Chrome]. This instance is a brand new window of [!DNL Chrome], and none of your old extensions will exist in this one. It also keeps cookies so you won't have to sign in to your Gmail every time.

**Cons**: Must have two windows of [!DNL Chrome ]open.

Use Another Browser

**Pros:** Using another internet browser (IE or Firefox) that doesn't have the extension installed will prevent this from happening.

**Cons**: Using multiple browsers can be annoying.

Use An Incognito Window

**Pros:** An incognito window is like opening a naked version of [!DNL Chrome]. Meaning it will not have any of your extensions installed, and [!DNL Sales Connect] won't be there to connect.

**Cons**: You will have to sign in to Gmail every time you start your day, and again if you accidentally close the window.
