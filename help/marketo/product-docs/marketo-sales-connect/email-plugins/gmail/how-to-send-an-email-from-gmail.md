# How to Send an Email From Gmail {#how-to-send-an-email-from-gmail}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Using the "Undo Send" functionality in Gmail will prevent the email from sending when using the Gmail extension, but you may still see an activity in the web application as well as in Salesforce if you're logging activities to Salesforce.

1. In Gmail, click **Compose**.

1. Enter the email address of the recipient.

1. Enter the email subject.

1. Select an email template or write a new message.

1. When your email is ready to send, click the **[!UICONTROL Send & Connect]** button. Clicking that button instead of the normal send button will ensure your email is sent with tracking applied. Sales Connect will track when your email is opened, and when someone clicks on any links.
