# [!DNL Sales Connect] Plugin Not Showing up in Gmail {#sales-connect-plugin-not-showing-up-in-gmail}

From our experience, here are some things to try if your toolbar is not appearing.

- Verify that our extension downloaded properly. If you're in [!DNL Chrome], pull up your list of extensions. Is [!DNL Sales Connect] (Tout) listed?

- What's your language set as in Gmail? If it's something other than English, try changing it to English.

- This may be obvious, but try exiting out of your browser and opening an entirely new window.

- Head over to the [web application](https://toutapp.com/login) and make sure you're logged in there.

- Make sure you have cookies enabled. If you're using [!DNL Chrome], go to [!UICONTROL Settings] > [!UICONTROL Show advanced settings] > [!UICONTROL Content settings] > Uncheck "[!UICONTROL Block third-party cookies and site data]."

- Try disconnecting then reconnecting the [!DNL Sales Connect] browser extension.
