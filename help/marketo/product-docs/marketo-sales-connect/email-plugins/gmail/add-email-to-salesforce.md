# Add Email to Salesforce {#add-email-to-salesforce}

Add Email to [!DNL Salesforce] allows you to push any emails you receive in [!DNL Outlook] or [!DNL Gmail] to your [!DNL Salesforce] account. We do the look up based on the sender of the email, so we can currently only use this button for emails you received, not emails you sent.

Add Email to [!DNL Salesforce] will help you log your emails to the Lead, Contact, Account, and Opportunity level. When logging to the Opportunity will log to all Opportunities the Contact is associated with.

We are working on changing the functionality to allow you to log emails you've already sent. But in the meantime, if it didn't automatically log when sent, or show up in your failed activities in the activity log, you can forward it to your [!DNL Salesforce] BCC email address.
