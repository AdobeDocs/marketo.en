# Unexpected Error in Gmail {#unexpected-error-in-gmail}

If you are receiving an "Unexpected Error" in Gmail when trying to send an email, you probably need to perform a reset on your Gmail connection.

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Email Tracking]** > **[!UICONTROL Manage]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Disconnect from Gmail]**.

1. After disconnecting, click **[!UICONTROL Connect to Google]**.

   Once you are reconnected, go back to Gmail and refresh your page and try sending your email again. If it still doesn't work, please [submit a ticket](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/Support/ct-p/Support) to our Support Team.
