# Unexpected Error in Gmail {#unexpected-error-in-gmail}

If you are receiving an "Unexpected Error" in Gmail when trying to send an email, you probably need to perform a reset on your Gmail connection.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Email Tracking** > **Manage**.

1. Click **Disconnect from Gmail**.

1. After disconnecting, click **Connect to Google**.

   Once you are reconnected, go back to Gmail and refresh your page and try sending your email again. If it still doesn't work, please [submit a ticket](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/Support/ct-p/Support) to our Support Team.
