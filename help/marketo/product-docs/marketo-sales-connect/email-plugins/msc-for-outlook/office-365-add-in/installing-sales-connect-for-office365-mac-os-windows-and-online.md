# Installing [!DNL Sales Connect] for [!DNL Office365] Mac OS, [!DNL Windows], and Online {#installing-sales-connect-for-office-mac-os-windows-and-online}

We have created an integration with [!DNL Outlook Web Apps]. [!DNL Outlook Web Apps] is a version of [!DNL Outlook] provided with the [!DNL Office 365] subscription. Since it's browser-based, the integration will work on both Mac and [!DNL Windows]. [Click here for the complete installation guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tout-user-store/outlook-mac/assets/install_tout_add-in_outlook_mac.pdf).

As an Admin, you can [install this on behalf of your entire team](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide).
