# Install the Sales Connect Email Plugin for Outlook (Online, Mac, and Windows) {#install-the-sales-connect-email-plugin-for-outlook}

We have created an integration with [!DNL Outlook Web Apps]. [!DNL Outlook Web Apps] is a version of [!DNL Outlook] provided with the [!DNL Office 365] subscription. Since it's browser-based, the integration will work on both Mac and [!DNL Windows]. [Click here for the complete installation guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tout-user-store/outlook-mac/assets/install_tout_add-in_outlook_mac.pdf).

As an Admin, you can [install this on behalf of your entire team](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The email plugins for Gmail and Outlook are supported for Marketo Sales Connect users only. They are **not** supported for Sales Insight Actions users.
