# Create a Follow-Up Email {#create-a-follow-up-email}

With Sales Connect's [Campaigns](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/campaigns/create-a-campaign.md) feature, creating a follow-up email is simple.

In the **Set Up** tab of your campaign, check the box to create an email as a follow-up, which will automatically thread your previous email into the next email in the campaign.
