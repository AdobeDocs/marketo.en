# Create Custom Dynamic Fields {#create-custom-dynamic-fields}

There are two ways to create custom dynamic fields.

## Saving Custom Fields for One or a Few Contacts {#saving-custom-fields-for-one-or-a-few-contacts}

1. Click the name of a contact in the People page.

1. Choose the drop-down next to Unsubscribe and select **Edit**.

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the edit page. You can then create a name and value for your field.

1. Click **Save**.

## Saving Custom Fields for Many Contacts {#saving-custom-fields-for-many-contacts}

1. Create a CSV spreadsheet with your custom fields in their own column.

1. Follow the [normal CSV upload process](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/people/managing-contacts/import-contacts-via-csv.md), stopping on the field mapping screen.

1. Instead of one of the preset fields, choose **Add a new Custom Field** from the drop-down.

1. Enter your desired field name and click **OK**.

1. Finish uploading your CSV. Your contacts will come through with the added custom field.

>After you've created your custom field it can take around 30 minutes for the field to appear in the dynamic field drop-down in your template editor.

## How to Use Your Custom Fields in a Template {#how-to-use-your-custom-fields-in-a-template}

Once your custom fields have been stored using the above methods, you'll be able to reference them in your templates.

1. [Create a template](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/templates/create-a-new-template.md) and click the **Dynamic Fields** button like you normally would.

1. Select **Custom Fields** from the drop-down that appears.

1. You'll see your pre-stored custom fields and be able to select one to fill out in your template.
