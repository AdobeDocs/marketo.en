# Reference Yourself in a Dynamic Field {#reference-yourself-in-a-dynamic-field}

Dynamic fields are our form of mail merge.

We allow you to personalize your email templates with predefined attributes like `{{my_name}}` or `{{my_title}}`. These fields allow you to quickly reference yourself in your email templates.

To add a self-referencing dynamic field to a template, just select the one you'd like to use from the **[!UICONTROL MSE Dynamic Fields]** button in the template editor.
