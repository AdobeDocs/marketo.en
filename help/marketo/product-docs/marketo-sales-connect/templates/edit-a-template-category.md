# Edit a Template Category {#edit-a-template-category}

We cannot delete an entire category or move templates in bulk to a new category at this time.  
  
What you can do is, edit each template within the Category to either an existing Category name or a brand new name. This will move all of your existing templates into a different folder. Once the folder is empty, it will disappear.  
  
We are working on adding the ability to do this en masse.
