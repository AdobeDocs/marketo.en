# Add Video Content {#add-video-content}

Unfortunately, adding video content to a template and having it play in-line in the sent message is not available at this time.

However, you can insert an inline image (GIFs included) in your templates by clicking the **Insert Image** button. One suggestion would be to insert a still image of the intended video, then making that image clickable by highlighting it and clicking the hyperlink icon to input the video URL.
