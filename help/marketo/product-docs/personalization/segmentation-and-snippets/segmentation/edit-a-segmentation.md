# Edit a Segmentation {#edit-a-segmentation}

Making changes to your existing segmentations is easy. Here's the low down.

1. The **[!UICONTROL Status]** changes to [!UICONTROL Approved with Draft]. A **[!UICONTROL Draft]** folder is created in your segmentation.

   >[!NOTE]

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You need to select a Segment before you can edit or delete it.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >Deleting affects all associated Dynamic Content in Emails, Landing Pages, and Snippets. **There is no undo**. Check the **[!UICONTROL Used By]** tab to see what uses that segment.

## Edit Segment Rules {#edit-segment-rules}

1. In your [!UICONTROL Draft] **Segment**, go to **[!UICONTROL Smart List]**. Apply rules similar to [Defining Segment Rules](/help/marketo/product-docs/personalization/segmentation-and-snippets/segmentation/define-segment-rules.md).

   >
   >You cannot edit your Approved Segments. Click on Segments in [!UICONTROL Draft] folder to edit them.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Remember to Approve your Segmentation Draft.

Feel free to experiment on segmentations that are not used in dynamic content.
