## Approve the Snippet {#approve-the-snippet}

No-Draft is triggered each time a snippet is approved. This includes a snippet that is shared or referenced by assets in other workspaces.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Design Studio]**.

1. Select an option in the Approve snippet dialog box and click **[!UICONTROL Approve]**:

    * **[!UICONTROL Update all]**: This option will not create drafts of the approved assets using the snippet. All assets get the updates and maintain their prior statuses. A progress module appears on the top right side of the screen; it can be closed at any time. To restore it, right-click the snippet name and select Show Approval Status.
    * **[!UICONTROL Create drafts]**: This option will create drafts of the approved assets using the snippet. Select this option if snippet changes need to be reviewed first. All drafts must be approved manually.
