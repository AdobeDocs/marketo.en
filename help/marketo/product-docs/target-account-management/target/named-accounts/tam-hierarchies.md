# TAM Hierarchies {#tam-hierarchies}

Hierarchies give TAM users the ability to inherit the parent/child relationships between Named Accounts in their CRM.

## What are TAM Hierarchies? {#what-are-tam-hierarchies}

Companies can have multiple divisions and subsidiaries. Those companies often organize themselves through parent-child relationships called hierarchies. TAM can inherit these hierarchies from your SFDC or MSD integration and allow you to work with the different divisions as a single family.

## Working with TAM Hierarchies {#working-with-tam-hierarchies}

With TAM Hierarchies, you can quickly obtain information about an entire hierarchy or individual accounts in the Named Account Dashboard.

Target and report on entire hierarchies with [one click](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/engage/account-filters.md#member-of-named-account).
