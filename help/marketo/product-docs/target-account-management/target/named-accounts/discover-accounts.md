# Discover Accounts {#discover-accounts}

Use the Discover option to identify potential target accounts.

## [!UICONTROL Discover CRM Accounts] {#discover-crm-accounts}

Identify potential target accounts from your CRM.

>[!NOTE]
>
>After you connect your CRM to Marketo TAM, **[!UICONTROL Discover CRM Accounts]** will show all the CRM accounts and relevant information to help you choose the right named accounts. Marketo adds additional information on top of what's received from the CRM.

**[!UICONTROL People]** (In [!UICONTROL Discover CRM Accounts] & [!UICONTROL Discover Marketo Companies]): Includes both Contacts and Leads. Leads can be discovered using Marketo's [lead-to-account matching](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/target/named-accounts/lead-to-account-matching.md).

**[!UICONTROL Potential People]** (In [!UICONTROL Discover CRM Accounts] & [!UICONTROL Discover Marketo Companies]): Shows how many leads Marketo found that could possibly belong to a CRM account.

**Custom CRM field** (In Discover CRM Accounts only): This will help you align your sales and marketing organization for selection of correct target accounts. Once you [map the custom CRM field](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/setup-tam/create-a-custom-field-for-crm-discovery.md) with Marketo TAM, we'll show you the mapped data to help you identify your target accounts.

1. In [!UICONTROL Named Accounts], click the **[!UICONTROL New]** drop-down and select **[!UICONTROL Discover CRM Accounts]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >In [!UICONTROL Discover Marketo Companies] and Discover CRM, Marketo automatically:
   >
   >* Finds people from your Marketo database that have that company listed in their record. If you see multiple values for some of the attributes (e.g., Industry), it's because Marketo found different values listed for those individual people. The attribute with the most hits wins
   >
   >In **Discover CRM** only, Marketo automatically:
   >
   >* Syncs and associates CRM Contacts with the [!UICONTROL Named Account]
   >
   >In **[!UICONTROL Discover Marketo Companies]** only, Marketo automatically:
   >
   >* Filters out most Internet Service Providers and Public Domains (e.g., yahoo.com, gmail.com) as company names
   >
   >* Dedupes CRM accounts. If you have "Acme" in one record and "Acme Inc" (or any of the following suffixes: Co, Corp, Corporation, Gmbh, Inc, Incorporated, LLC, LLP, LP, Ltd, PA, PC, PLC, PLLC), we will merge them in TAM as just "Acme"

   >
   >Going forward, any new people from these selected companies will automatically be assigned to their respective named accounts. Please double-check these companies and make sure they are assigned to the correct [!UICONTROL Named Account].

1. To select an existing Account, click the **[!UICONTROL Named Account]** drop-down, choose the desired account, then click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you're seeing a mismatch between CRM accounts you've selected and what's in the Discover CRM Grid, it's likely due to one or more of the following:
>
>* Having different CRM accounts with similar names that got de-duped
>* The next scheduled sync hasn't occurred yet
