If you use the "is any" qualifier, you may want to utilize [constraints](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/using-smart-lists/add-a-constraint-to-a-smart-list-filter.md) to narrow your search results. Add as many as you'd like!

   ![](assets/nine.png)

Set "Include Children" to false if you only want members from the single, top-level account. Select true if you want members from all child accounts.
