## Dashboard {#dashboard}

The dashboard aggregates key insights at an account level from all the people within a named account, thus avoiding the need of going to each person to evaluate their progress. You can drill down deeper into email activity using [Email Insights](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/email-insights/filtering-in-email-insights.md#account-based-marketing).

>Charts show insights from the last 90 days.

   <td><p>See week-to-week engagement based on all the account scores you created in Admin. You can compare these account scores side-by-side. To determine weekly engagement, we take the max engagement from any day of the week.</p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><strong>Pipeline</strong></td>
