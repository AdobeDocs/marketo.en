# Account Profiling Ranking and Tuning {#account-profiling-ranking-and-tuning}

Account Profiling identifies your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), ranks companies in your database based on the ICP, and adds ICP Indicator data to accounts promoted as [!UICONTROL Named Accounts].

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>As of 2025, Account Profiling is no longer available for new users. It will continue to work for existing users.

## Model Results {#model-results}

The results show you all of your known accounts broken down by grade. A is the highest grade, D is the lowest.

![](assets/results.png)

While optional, we recommend selecting the Automatically promote checkbox, as it will save you a ton of time. However, if you'd like to go through each account and [add them manually](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/target/named-accounts/discover-accounts.md#discover-crm-accounts), simply leave the box unchecked.
