   >New Accounts shows a list of accounts that are not yours in ABM, yet. They are accounts that have the potential to be new for you based on filters you select.

1. Select all applicable filters (this part is highly customizable, the following is just one example to demonstrate filtering).

   >If you only see a few accounts you want, you have the option of clicking on individual accounts and clicking **Save Selected Accounts** when done.

1. You can make your list its own new Account List, or add it to an existing one. In this example, we'll create a new one.
