   >If you make an update, it may take some time for the changes to reflect in TAM.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* When Multiple CRM Accounts with different account owners are merged into a Named Account, Marketo will pick one "Account Owner" and add other account owners as "Account Co-Owners"
   >
   >* If a CRM "Role" field is later renamed or deleted, Marketo TAM will stop syncing the updated values until the user manually updates the setup in TAM
