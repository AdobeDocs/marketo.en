# Getting Started with TAM {#getting-started-with-tam}

Get Marketo Engage TAM added to your instance? Great! Let's take a look at what you need to do next.

**Step One: [Issue a License](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/setup-tam/issue-a-license.md){target="_blank"}** - Decide who on your team is going to be using TAM.

**Step Two: Set [Permissions](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/setup-tam/permissions.md){target="_blank"}** - Assign specific aspects of TAM to certain users, or simply grant full TAM access.

**Step Three: Configure your [Account Score](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/setup-tam/account-score.md){target="_blank"}** - Account Scoring is one of the key elements in Target Account Management. It helps you determine the level of engagement of each account.

**Step Four: [Create a Custom Field for CRM Discovery](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/setup-tam/create-a-custom-field-for-crm-discovery.md){target="_blank"}** - Map an existing CRM Account field to a new Named Account custom field (if you don't use a CRM, skip this step).

**Step Five:** **_Create Named Accounts_** - Named Accounts hold the people from the companies you're targeting. There are four ways to create a named account:

* [Import Named Accounts](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/target/named-accounts/import-named-accounts.md){target="_blank"} - Upload a list of potential target accounts directly into TAM (this can be a list that you exported from your CRM)
* [Discover CRM Accounts](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/target/named-accounts/discover-accounts.md#discover-crm-accounts){target="_blank"} - View a list of all CRM accounts synced into Marketo and filter using key attributes (i.e. industry) to create named accounts
* [Discover Marketo Companies](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/target/named-accounts/discover-accounts.md#discover-marketo-companies){target="_blank"} - View a list of companies from sources other than your CRM and filter using key attributes to create named accounts
* [Create a named account manually](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/target/named-accounts/create-a-named-account.md){target="_blank"} - If you create a named account manually, your next step is to [fill it with people](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/target/named-accounts/add-people-to-a-named-account.md){target="_blank"} manually

**OPTIONAL STEP: [Create and set-up Account Lists](/help/marketo/product-docs/target-account-management/target/account-lists.md#create-a-new-account-list){target="_blank"}** - Group accounts into lists allowing you to target named accounts by industry, location, or size of the company.

After following the steps above, you are ready to start using TAM!
