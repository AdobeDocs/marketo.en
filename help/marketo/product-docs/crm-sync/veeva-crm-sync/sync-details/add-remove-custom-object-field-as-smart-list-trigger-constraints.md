# Add/Remove Custom Object Field as Smart List/Trigger Constraints {#add-remove-custom-object-field-as-smart-list-trigger-constraints}

Marketo Engage provides specific control over the [!DNL Veeva] custom object sync. This allows you to select the fields available as constraints in custom object filters and to use them as triggers in Smart Campaigns.
