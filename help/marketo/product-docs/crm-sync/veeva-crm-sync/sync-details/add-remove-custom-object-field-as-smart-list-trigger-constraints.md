# Add/Remove Custom Object Field as Smart List/Trigger Constraints {#add-remove-custom-object-field-as-smart-list-trigger-constraints}

Marketo Engage provides specific control over the Veeva custom object sync. This allows you to select the fields available as constraints in custom object filters and to use them as triggers in Smart Campaigns.
