# Understanding the [!DNL Salesforce] Sync {#understanding-the-salesforce-sync}

Marketo Engage and Salesforce go together like peas and carrots. We keep your sales and marketing data in sync.

## How Sync Works {#how-sync-works}

Marketo syncs with [!DNL Salesforce] all day, every day. Each sync takes some time and then pauses for 5 minutes, then starts again.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The very first sync in your subscription may take hours or even days because Marketo is copying the entire database from [!DNL Salesforce]. After that, each sync typically takes seconds or minutes and only syncs data that has changed.

The sync between [!DNL Salesforce] and Marketo is bidirectional only for leads, contacts, and [!DNL Salesforce] campaigns. In these cases, whenever you make changes in either [!DNL Salesforce] or Marketo, your updates will be reflected in both systems. All other syncs are from [!DNL Salesforce] to Marketo only. Click the links below for details on each one.

Marketo's sync with [!DNL Salesforce] is the most powerful of its kind in the world. It feels like magic; a change is made and the other system is soon up-to-date.
