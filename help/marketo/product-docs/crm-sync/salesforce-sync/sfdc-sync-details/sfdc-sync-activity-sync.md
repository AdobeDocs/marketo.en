# SFDC Sync: Activity Sync {#sfdc-sync-activity-sync}

Marketo also syncs over the [!DNL Salesforce] activities data. Here are some questions and answers.

## What types of activity data does Marketo sync over? {#what-types-of-activity-data-does-marketo-sync-over}

Marketo syncs over both Events and Tasks associated with a lead or contact.

## How are activity details kept in sync between the two systems? {#how-are-activity-details-kept-in-sync-between-the-two-systems}

The sync is one way, from [!DNL Salesforce] to Marketo. But you can create a task in [!DNL Salesforce] using the [Create Task](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/salesforce-flow-actions/create-task.md) flow step or [Customize Activities Sync](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/salesforce-sync/setup/optional-steps/customize-activities-sync.md) to [!DNL Salesforce].

## Can I create a task using Marketo? {#can-i-create-a-task-using-marketo}

Yes, you can use the [Create Task flow action](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/salesforce-flow-actions/create-task.md){target="_blank"}.

## What are the triggers/filters related to activity? {#what-are-the-triggers-filters-related-to-activity}

Triggers

* Activity is Logged
* Activity is Updated

Filters

* Activity was Logged/Not Activity was Logged
* Activity was Updated/Not Activity was Updated

>[!TIP]
>
>Not sure about that "Not Activity" wording? The "not" refers to an Inactivity Filter. Learn more about them here: [Use Inactivity Filters in a Smart List](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/using-smart-lists/use-inactivity-filters-in-a-smart-list.md){target="_blank"}
