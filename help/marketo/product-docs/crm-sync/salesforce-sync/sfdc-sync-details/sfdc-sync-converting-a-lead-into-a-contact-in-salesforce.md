# SFDC Sync: Converting a Lead into a Contact in [!DNL Salesforce] {#sfdc-sync-converting-a-lead-into-a-contact-in-salesforce}

Imagine three different scenarios in [!DNL Salesforce]: (not using the [Convert Person flow step](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/flow-actions/convert-person.md) in Marketo)

1. Converting a Lead into a **new contact and new account**
1. Converting a Lead into a **new contact** in an **existing account**

1. Converting a Lead to an **existing contact** in an **existing account** (this works identical to [merging](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/salesforce-sync/sfdc-sync-details/sfdc-sync-merging-a-lead-contact-person.md){target="_blank"})

In all three cases you end up with **1 contact and no leads in [!DNL Salesforce] and 1 contact and no people in Marketo.**

In Marketo, the record will now have an SFDC Type = Contact.

>[!TIP]
>
>When converting in [!DNL Salesforce], make sure your [lead custom fields are mapped well](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=customize_mapleads.htm). You don't want to lose any data.

You can trigger and filter using: “[!UICONTROL Lead is Converted]” and “[!UICONTROL Lead was Converted].”
