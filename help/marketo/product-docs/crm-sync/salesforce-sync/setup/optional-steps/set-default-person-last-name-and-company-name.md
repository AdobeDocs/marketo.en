# Set Default Person Last Name and Company Name {#set-default-person-last-name-and-company-name}

[!DNL Salesforce] requires (minimum) last name and company name for its Leads and Contacts. Incomplete records will not sync to [!DNL Salesforce]. If you wish to sync partial records, you must set default values for Marketo to use with [!DNL Salesforce].

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** and click **[!DNL Salesforce]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Marketo Engage only assigns a default value when the record is initially synced to Salesforce, and only if either of the required fields are empty.

And that's that! Every time a person is missing a last name and/or company name, Marketo will add the default value as it syncs the record over.
