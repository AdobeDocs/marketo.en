In this article, you will customize field permissions with a [!DNL Salesforce] Page Layout and create a Marketo-[!DNL Salesforce] sync user.

## Set Page Layouts {#set-page-layouts}

[!DNL Salesforce] Professional sets field level accessibility with Page Layouts, as opposed to [!DNL Salesforce] Enterprise/Unlimited's Profiles. Following these steps will allow the Marketo sync user to update the custom fields.

1. Type "[!UICONTROL page layouts]" in the Nav search bar without pressing **[!UICONTROL Enter]**, and click **[!UICONTROL Page Layout]** under **[!UICONTROL Leads]**.

1. Repeat the above step for the following fields:

    * [!UICONTROL Acquisition Program]
    * [!UICONTROL Acquisition Program Id]
    * [!UICONTROL Email Opt Out]
    * [!UICONTROL Inferred City]
    * [!UICONTROL Inferred Company]
    * [!UICONTROL Inferred Country]
    * [!UICONTROL Inferred Metropolitan Area]
    * [!UICONTROL Inferred Phone Area Code]
    * [!UICONTROL Inferred Postal Code]
    * [!UICONTROL Inferred State Region]
    * [!UICONTROL Lead Score]
    * [!UICONTROL Original Referrer]
    * [!UICONTROL Original Search Engine]
    * [!UICONTROL Original Search Phrase]
    * [!UICONTROL Original Source Info]
    * [!UICONTROL Original Source Type]

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >These fields need to be on the page layout so that Marketo can read/write to them.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Create two columns for the fields by dragging down to the right side of the page. You can move fields from one side to the other to balance the column lengths.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** when finished adding fields.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Make sure that the **[!UICONTROL All-Day Event]** field has been added to the **[!UICONTROL Event Page Layout]**.

## Create Sync User {#create-sync-user}

Marketo requires credentials to access [!DNL Salesforce]. This is best done with a dedicated user created with the steps below.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your organization has no additional Salesforce licenses, you can use an existing Marketing user with the System Administrator profile.

1. Enter "users" in the Nav search bar, and click **[!UICONTROL Users]** under **[!UICONTROL Manage Users]**.

   ![](assets/image2014-12-9-12-3a57-3a42.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL New User]**.

   ![](assets/image2014-12-9-12-3a58-3a1.png)

1. Fill in the required fields, select the **[!UICONTROL User License: Salesforce]**, set the **[!UICONTROL Profile: System Administrator]**, check **[!UICONTROL Marketing User]** and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Make sure the email address you enter is valid. You will need to log in as the sync user to reset the password.

Excellent! Now you have an account that Marketo can use to connect to [!DNL Salesforce]. Let's do it.
