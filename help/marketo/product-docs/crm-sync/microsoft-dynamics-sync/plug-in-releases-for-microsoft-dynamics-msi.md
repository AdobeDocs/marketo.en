# Plug-In Releases for [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] MSI {#plug-in-releases-for-microsoft-dynamics-msi}

When you first sync to [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics], you download and install the latest version of the plug-ins for Marketo Sales Insight (MSI). Periodically, Marketo updates these plug-ins, so you can return to the same place to download the new version.

If you're using Marketo's native CRM sync solution to [!DNL Dynamics], please [download the latest plug-in](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-for-microsoft-dynamics/installing/download-the-marketo-sales-insight-solution-for-microsoft-dynamics.md){target="_blank"} corresponding to your [!DNL Dynamics] release. For those who have a custom sync and have purchased Marketo Sales Insight, the [package is here](https://mktg-cdn.marketo.com/community/MarketoSalesInsight_NonNative.zip){target="_blank"}.

>[!NOTE]
>
>These versions work for both on-premise and online versions of [!DNL Dynamics].
