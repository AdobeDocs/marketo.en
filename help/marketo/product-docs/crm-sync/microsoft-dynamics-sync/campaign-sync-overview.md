# Campaign Sync Overview {#campaign-sync-overview}

As part of Campaign Sync, users can set up automation to operate on membership of a Dynamics campaign. Leads qualified to specific behaviors or demographics can be made part of Microsoft campaigns.

>[!PREREQUISITES]

>Update to the latest version of the Dynamics plug-in for Marketo.

The following flow actions are available:

* Add to Microsoft Campaign
* Remove from Microsoft Campaign

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Remove from Microsoft Campaign** will only remove people that were added using flow actions in Marketo.

There are also two triggers:

* Added to Microsoft Campaign
* Removed from Microsoft Campaign

The triggers will execute based on actions from the Marketo Flow Action “Add to Microsoft Campaign” and “Removed from Microsoft Campaign”.  

>[!NOTE]

>Make sure the Campaign Sync is functional and the campaign is not inactive in Microsoft Dynamics.
