Azure Active Directory extends your on-premises directories into the cloud, providing support for MS Dynamics 365 CRM with on-premise ADFS authentication.

## Registering a New App {#registering-a-new-app}

1. [Log in](https://login.microsoftonline.com/){target="_blank"} to the Microsoft Azure management portal using an account with admin permissions. You can also access the Microsoft Azure portal through the Office 365 Admin Center by expanding the **Admin** item in the left navigation pane and selecting **Azure AD**.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >You must use an account in the same Office 365 subscription as the one you intend to register the app with.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, you can [sign up](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/){target="_blank"} for one. Please refer to Microsoft's documentation or reach out to your Microsoft representative for more information. Once you've created an Azure account, you can register one or more apps using the procedure outlined below.
