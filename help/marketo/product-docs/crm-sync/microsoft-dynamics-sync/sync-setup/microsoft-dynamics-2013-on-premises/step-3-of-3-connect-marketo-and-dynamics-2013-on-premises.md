# Step 3 of 3: Connect Marketo and Dynamics (2013 On-Premises) {#step-of-connect-marketo-and-dynamics-on-premises}

>[!NOTE]

>**FYI**

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).
