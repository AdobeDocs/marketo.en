   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Marketo stores a reference to the fields to sync. If you delete a field in [!DNL Dynamics], we recommended doing so with the [sync disabled](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/salesforce-sync/enable-disable-the-salesforce-sync.md). Then refresh the schema in Marketo by editing and saving the [Select Fields to Sync](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/microsoft-dynamics-sync/microsoft-dynamics-sync-details/microsoft-dynamics-sync-field-sync/editing-fields-to-sync-before-deleting-them-in-dynamics.md).

## Sync Fields for a Custom Filter {#sync-fields-for-a-custom-filter}

If you've created a custom filter, be sure to go in and select the new fields to be synced with Marketo.

1. Go to Admin and select **[!UICONTROL Microsoft Dynamics]**.

1. Scroll down to the field and check it. The actual name must be new_synctomkto but the Display Name can be anything. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   >Marketo will not automatically de-dupe against a [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] sync, or when you manually enter people or leads.

1. Read everything in the pop-up, enter your email, and click **[!UICONTROL Start Sync]**.
