# Step 3 of 3: Connect Microsoft Dynamics with Marketo (2011 On-Premises) {#step-of-connect-microsoft-dynamics-with-marketo-on-premises}

>**FYI**

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

Alright! We installed the solution and configured the sync user. Next, we need to connect Marketo and Dynamics.
