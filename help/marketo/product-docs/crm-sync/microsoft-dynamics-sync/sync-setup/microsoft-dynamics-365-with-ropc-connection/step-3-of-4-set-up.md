## [!DNL Azure AD] Federated with [!DNL AD FS On-prem] {#azure-ad-federated-with-ad-fs-on-prem}

Federated [!DNL Azure] AD to [!DNL ADFS Onprem] needs the creation of a Home Realm Discovery policy for the specific application. With this policy, [!DNL Azure] AD will redirect the authentication request to the federation service. Password hash synchronization has to be enabled in [!DNL AD Connect] for this. For more information, please see [[!DNL OAuth] with [!DNL ROPC]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth-ropc) and [Set an hrd policy for an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-authentication-for-federated-users-portal#example-set-an-hrd-policy-for-an-application).

## Before Proceeding to Step 4 {#before-proceeding-to-step-4}

* If you want to restrict the number of records you sync, [set up a custom sync filter](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/microsoft-dynamics-sync/create-a-custom-dynamics-sync-filter.md) now.
* Run the [Validate [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] Sync](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/microsoft-dynamics-sync/sync-setup/validate-microsoft-dynamics-sync.md) process. It verifies that your initial setups were done correctly.
* Log in to the Marketo Sync User in [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] CRM.
