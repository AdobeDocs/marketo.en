>[!NOTE]

>Marketo stores a reference to the fields to sync. If you delete a field in Dynamics, we recommended doing so with the [sync disabled](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/salesforce-sync/enable-disable-the-salesforce-sync.md). Then refresh the schema in Marketo by editing and saving the [Select Fields to Sync](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/microsoft-dynamics-sync/microsoft-dynamics-sync-details/microsoft-dynamics-sync-field-sync/editing-fields-to-sync-before-deleting-them-in-dynamics.md).
