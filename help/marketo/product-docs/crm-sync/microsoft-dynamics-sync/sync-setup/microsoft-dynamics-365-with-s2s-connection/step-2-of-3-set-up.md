1. Write down the Application ID (ClientId) and Tenant ID. You'll need to  enter it in Marketo later.

1. Grant Admin consent by following the steps [in this article](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/microsoft-dynamics-sync/sync-setup/grant-consent-for-client-id-and-app-registration.md).

## Create Application User in Microsoft {#create-application-user-in-microsoft}

1. Follow steps from the following link to [set up an application user in  Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/use-single-tenant-server-server-authentication#application-user-creation).

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >* While giving permissions to the Application User, be sure to assign it to "Marketo Sync User Role."
   >* Note the email address of the Application User from the [view details option](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/manage-application-users#view-or-edit-the-details-of-an-application-user) on Power Platform. This email address will be used as the username when setting up the connection to MS [!DNL Dynamics] within Marketo.  

## [!DNL Azure AD] Federated with [!DNL AD FS On-prem] {#azure-ad-federated-with-ad-fs-on-prem}

Federated [!DNL Azure AD] to [!DNL ADFS Onprem] needs the creation of a Home Realm Discovery policy for the specific application. With this policy, [!DNL Azure AD] will redirect the authentication request to the federation service. Password hash synchronization has to be enabled in [!DNL AD Connect] for this. For more information, please see [[!DNL OAuth] with [!DNL ROPC]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth-ropc) and [Set an hrd policy for an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-authentication-for-federated-users-portal#example-set-an-hrd-policy-for-an-application).

   >If youâ€™re upgrading from Basic Authentication to [!DNL OAuth], you can use [this article](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/microsoft-dynamics-sync/sync-setup/reconfigure-dynamics-authentication-method.md) to reconfigure your authentication.

## Before Proceeding to Step 3 {#before-proceeding-to-step}

* If you want to restrict the number of records you sync, [set up a custom sync filter](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/microsoft-dynamics-sync/create-a-custom-dynamics-sync-filter.md) now.
* Run the [Validate [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] Sync](/help/marketo/product-docs/crm-sync/microsoft-dynamics-sync/sync-setup/validate-microsoft-dynamics-sync.md) process. It verifies that your initial setups were done correctly.
* Log in to the Marketo Sync User in [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] CRM.
