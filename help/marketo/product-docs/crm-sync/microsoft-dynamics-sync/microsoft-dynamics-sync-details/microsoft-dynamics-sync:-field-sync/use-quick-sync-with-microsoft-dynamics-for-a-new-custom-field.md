# Use Quick Sync with Microsoft Dynamics for a New Custom Field {#use-quick-sync-with-microsoft-dynamics-for-a-new-custom-field}

Marketing or Sales wants a new field. Or, maybe you forgot one in your initial field selection. Or, your needs changed. In any case, you can use Quick Sync to resync specific fields.

Normally, youâ€™ll use Quick Sync to add a new field and have values refreshed. However, there are cases where you might want to sync an existing field. You can restrict the field sync based on an updated or created date range.&nbsp;See [Advanced Sync Options](#Advanced_Sync_Options) below for details.

Quick Sync can sync null values. For example, if you are using values A and B, and change a B value in Dynamics to null, it will sync the null value to Marketo.
