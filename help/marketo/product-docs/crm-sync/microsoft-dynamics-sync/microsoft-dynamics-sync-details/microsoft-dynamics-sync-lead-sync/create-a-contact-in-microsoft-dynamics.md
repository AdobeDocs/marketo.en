   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When using the "[!UICONTROL Sync Person to Microsoft]" flow action (in a Trigger Campaign only), the lead/contact will be created in real-time in Dynamics.

1. Marketo qualifies that Lead record in [!DNL Dynamics] into a Contact that is not associated to any Account in [!DNL Dynamics].
