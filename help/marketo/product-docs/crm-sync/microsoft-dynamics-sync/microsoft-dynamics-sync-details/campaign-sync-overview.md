# Campaign Sync Overview {#campaign-sync-overview}

As part of Campaign Sync, users can set up automation to operate on membership of a Dynamics campaign. Leads qualified to specific behaviors or demographics can be made part of Microsoft campaigns.

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>Update to the latest version of the Dynamics plug-in for Marketo Engage.

The following flow actions are available:

* [!UICONTROL Add to Microsoft Campaign]
* [!UICONTROL Remove from Microsoft Campaign]

>[!NOTE]
>
>**[!UICONTROL Remove from Microsoft Campaign]** will only remove people that were added using flow actions in Marketo.

There are also two triggers:

* [!UICONTROL Added to Microsoft Campaign]
* [!UICONTROL Removed from Microsoft Campaign]

The triggers will execute based on actions from the Marketo Flow Action "[!UICONTROL Add to Microsoft Campaign]" and "[!UICONTROL Removed from Microsoft Campaign]."

>[!NOTE]
>
>Make sure the Campaign Sync is functional and the campaign is not inactive in Microsoft Dynamics.
