# Campaign Sync Overview {#campaign-sync-overview}

As part of Campaign Sync, users can set up automation to operate on membership of a [!DNL Dynamics] campaign. Leads qualified to specific behaviors or demographics can be made part of Microsoft campaigns.

>[!PREREQUISITES]

>Update to the latest version of the [!DNL Dynamics] plug-in for Marketo.

The following flow actions are available:

* [!UICONTROL Add to Microsoft Campaign]
* [!UICONTROL Remove from Microsoft Campaign]

>[!NOTE]

>**[!UICONTROL Remove from Microsoft Campaign]** will only remove people that were added using flow actions in Marketo.

There are also two triggers:

* [!UICONTROL Added to Microsoft Campaign]
* [!UICONTROL Removed from Microsoft Campaign]

The triggers will execute based on actions from the Marketo Flow Action "[!UICONTROL Add to Microsoft Campaign]" and "[!UICONTROL Removed from Microsoft Campaign]."

>[!NOTE]

>Make sure the Campaign Sync is functional and the campaign is not inactive in Microsoft [!DNL Dynamics].
