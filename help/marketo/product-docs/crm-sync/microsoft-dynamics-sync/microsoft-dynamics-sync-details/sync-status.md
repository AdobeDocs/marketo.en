   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When you're looking at the [!UICONTROL Last Hour] view, the [!UICONTROL Inserts] and [!UICONTROL Updates] columns display N/A. This is expected behavior.

## [!UICONTROL Sync Errors] Tab {#sync-errors-tab}

Browse, search, or export leads (and other objects) that failed to synchronize with details such as operation, direction, error code and error message.
