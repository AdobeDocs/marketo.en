   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When you're looking at the Last Hour view, the Inserts and Updates columns display N/A. This is expected behavior.

## Sync Errors Tab {#sync-errors-tab}

Browse, search, or export leads (and other objects) that failed to synchronize with details such as operation, direction, error code and error message.
