# Unified Shell Overview {#unified-shell-overview}

Unified Shell aligns the "shell" look and feel of Adobe Experience Cloud applications and services. But, it's more than just a new design. It's a single-page application that delivers user experience in a single instance.

## User Flow {#user-flow}

If you're already logged in to an Adobe Experience Cloud product, click the menu icon and select **[!DNL Marketo Measure]**.

Here is what is changing for Marketo:

Logging in will be done through Experience Cloud/IMS

Accessing your Marketo instance will be done through the "Marketo Launch Page" which will have a tile for each Marketo instance the user has access to in their organization. They can then launch Marketo by clicking on the tile.

User History, Global Search, Marketo Notifications, and Task Tray are moving from the top bar to a new bar on the left hand side

History tree in My Marketo is going away

Bookmarks won't work (for now). We don't need to call this out right now but remove it if you're copying any text from Bizible's doc (their bookmarks work).
