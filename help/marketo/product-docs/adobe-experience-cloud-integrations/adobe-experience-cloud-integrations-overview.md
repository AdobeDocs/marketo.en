# Adobe Experience Cloud Integrations Overview{#adobe-experience-cloud-integrations-overview}

Adobe offers a robust demand marketing solution, starting with native audience syncing across the Adobe Experience Cloud products. Marketo Engage integrates with some of those products. Leverage unique B2B-centric data across Adobe Audience Manager, unlocking powerful demand marketing uses cases and untapped potential for existing Adobe applications. 

>[!NOTE]

>The integrations, which include Audience Manager, B2B CDP Marketo Connector, and Dynamic Chat, can require mapping of the IMS org in Marketo Engage.
