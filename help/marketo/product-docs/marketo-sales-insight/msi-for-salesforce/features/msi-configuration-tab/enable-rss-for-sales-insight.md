# Enable RSS for [!DNL Sales Insight] {#enable-rss-for-sales-insight}

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Admin Permissions Required**

If Marketo users want to view their lead feed not only in [!DNL Salesforce], but also in an RSS feed, a Marketo Admin must enable it first. It's easy.

1. In My Marketo, click **[!UICONTROL Admin]** and then **[!DNL Sales Insight]**.

   The RSS feed now displays as **[!UICONTROL Enabled]**.
