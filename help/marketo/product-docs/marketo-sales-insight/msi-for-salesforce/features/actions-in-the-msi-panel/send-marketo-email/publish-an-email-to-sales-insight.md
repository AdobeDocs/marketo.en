Nice job! Now you know how to make emails available for your sales team to send on the CRM side, and to limit their available time, if necessary.

>[My Tokens](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/programs/tokens/understanding-my-tokens-in-a-program.md) will not resolve when sending an email from Sales Insight on either Microsoft Dynamics or Salesforce; only standard tokens will populate (Lead, Company, etc.). Default values for tokens will work, however.
