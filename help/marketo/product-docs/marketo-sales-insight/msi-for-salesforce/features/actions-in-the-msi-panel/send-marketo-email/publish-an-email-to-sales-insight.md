   >At 11:59 p.m. (CST) on the expiration date (if you set one), the email you made available will disappear from [!DNL Sales Insight] as well as any of its add-ins. It will of course still be accessible in Marketo.

1. Click **[!DNL Save]**.

Nice job! Now you know how to make emails available for your sales team to send on the CRM side, and to limit their available time, if necessary.

>[!NOTE]
>
>[My Tokens](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/programs/tokens/understanding-my-tokens-in-a-program.md) will not resolve when sending an email from [!DNL Sales Insight] on either [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] or [!DNL Salesforce]; only standard tokens will populate (Lead, Company, etc.). Default values for tokens will work, however.
