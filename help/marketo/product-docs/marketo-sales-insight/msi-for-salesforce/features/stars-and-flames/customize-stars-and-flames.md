# Customize Stars and Flames {#customize-stars-and-flames}

[!DNL Marketo Sales Insight] uses stars and flames to prioritize leads. Marketo automatically decides who gets 1-2-3 stars/flames. However, you can modify the formula. Here's how:

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Scoring Method]** of your choice.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >**Definition**
   >
   >**[!UICONTROL Dynamic]** - Is a percentage value that is derived from [relative data](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-for-salesforce/features/stars-and-flames/priority-urgency-relative-score-and-best-bets.md). Awesome stuff. This method is recommended.
   >
   >**[!UICONTROL Static]** - Allows you to define exact score numbers - no more percentages, no more secret sauces.

   >[!TIP]
