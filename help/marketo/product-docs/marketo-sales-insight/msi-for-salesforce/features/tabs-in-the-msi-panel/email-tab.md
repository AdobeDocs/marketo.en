# Email Tab {#email-tab}

The email tab shows you a list of all the emails sent to a contact or lead. It includes the following columns:

* Subject  
* Date
* Opened
* Clicked

An email with the Marketo icon next to the subject line indicates that email was sent from Marketo. An email without the Marketo icon indicates that email was sent from Sales Insight.

You can click on the “Check Delivery Status” button to open a new tab which shows the delivery status of emails:

   <td><strong>Emails sent from Marketo</strong></td>
   <td>Sent, Delivered, Bounced, Soft Bounce</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Emails sent from Sales Insight</strong></td>

  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
