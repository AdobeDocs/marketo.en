# Using Interesting Moments {#using-interesting-moments}

Interesting moments are the key to communicating with your sales team through the [!DNL Marketo Sales Insight] app.

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>These are available to [!DNL Marketo Sales Insight] and [[!DNL Marketo Sales Connect]](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-connect/marketo/interesting-moments-in-sales-connect.md) customers only.

## What is an interesting moment? {#what-is-an-interesting-moment}

That's up to you! You decide what information is relevant to your sales team. Your sales team might want to know when a lead:

* Visits the pricing page on your website
* Clicks a link in a new product announcement email
* Requests a product demo

## How do I create an interesting moment?  {#how-do-i-create-an-interesting-moment}

1. Choose a [smart campaign](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/understanding-smart-campaigns.md), preferably one your sales team would find interesting if triggered.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Marketo will also add the date it occurred and how the interesting moment was added (i.e lead action > flow step, SOAP API).

## How can this get even more interesting?  {#how-can-this-get-even-more-interesting}

Tokens! Add them in the description field to provide your sales team with more specific information like the subject line of the email the lead opened, or who was it sent by. Check out which tokens are available for use in the [Tokens for Interesting Moments](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-for-salesforce/features/tabs-in-the-msi-panel/interesting-moments/trigger-tokens-for-interesting-moments.md) glossary.

>[!TIP]
>
>Start with five interesting moments, then work with your sales team to determine what information they are interested in seeing.
