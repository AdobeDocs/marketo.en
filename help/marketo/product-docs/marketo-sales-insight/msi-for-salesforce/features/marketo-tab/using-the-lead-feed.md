# Using the Lead Feed {#using-the-lead-feed}

The Lead Feed is an up-to-the-minute list of interesting events done by your leads. You'll find it on the right-hand side when you click the Marketo tab. It's like an RSS or [!DNL Twitter] feed - the most recent updates are at the top of the list. Use this to jump on leads while you're still fresh in their minds.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The lead feed includes both the leads you own and the leads in your watch list.

## What's in the Lead Feed? {#whats-in-the-lead-feed}

Each item in the lead feed is an interesting moment - a noteworthy activity or event in this lead's marketing history.

When viewing it in [!DNL Salesforce], each item has:

<table>

 <tbody> 
  <tr>

   <td><p>A. Lead/Contact</p></td> 
   <td><p>Person who had this interesting moment</p></td>

   <td><p>B. Event Type</p></td> 
   <td><p>Category for this moment -- web, email, or milestone</p></td> 
  </tr>

   <td><p>C. Account Name</p></td> 
   <td><p>Company name</p></td> 
  </tr>

   <td><p>D. Time</p></td> 
   <td><p>When this interesting moment occurred</p></td> 
  </tr>

   <td><p>E. Event Description</p></td> 
   <td><p>Reason for this interesting moment</p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><p>F. Subscribe</p></td> 
   <td><p>Receive email notification for events like this</p></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><p>G. Star</p></td> 
   <td><p>This person is a Best Bet (high priority)</p></td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>

## Getting RSS Updates {#getting-rss-updates}

You can also get Lead Feed updates by RSS feed.  An RSS feed lets you receive updates on your leads even if you're not connected to [!DNL Salesforce]. The feed has the same information as the Lead Feed in [!DNL Salesforce] as well as the following (when available):

* email address
* phone number
* mobile number
* fax number
* company address
* company URL

>[!NOTE]
>
>Your company's Marketo administrator must [enable RSS feeds](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-for-salesforce/features/msi-configuration-tab/enable-rss-for-sales-insight.md) for this to work.

To get RSS updates, you'll need two things: the RSS link and an RSS feed reader. You can get the RSS link by clicking the RSS icon in the lead feed:

The RSS feed will appear in a new window. You can then copy the URL for your RSS feed and use it in an RSS reader. Most browsers have a built-in RSS reader, or you can use an RSS reader specific to your platform.
