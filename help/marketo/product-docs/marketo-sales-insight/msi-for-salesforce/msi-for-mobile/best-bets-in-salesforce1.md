# Best Bets in Salesforce1 {#best-bets-in-salesforce}

Your [Best Bets](../../../../product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-for-salesforce/features/stars-and-flames/priority-urgency-relative-score-and-best-bets.md) are your leads and contacts with the highest urgency and relative score. Only the leads you own are visible in that list, and the list is updated as lead scores change.

1. Go to the Marketo area in the Salesforce app.

   In the drop-down, you can choose “My Best Bets”, “My Watch List”, “Web Activity”, “Anonymous Web Activity”, or “My Email.”
