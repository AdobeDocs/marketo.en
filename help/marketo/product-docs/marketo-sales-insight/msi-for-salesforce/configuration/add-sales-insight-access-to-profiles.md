# Add [!DNL Sales Insight] Access to Profiles {#add-sales-insight-access-to-profiles}

Here's how to create a profile with access to [!DNL Sales Insight] while removing access for your other profiles. This is for users who have already installed the [[!DNL Sales Insight] AppExchange package](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-for-salesforce/installation/install-marketo-sales-insight-package-in-salesforce-appexchange.md){target="_blank"}.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you’ve previously given [!DNL Sales Insight] access to all profiles, you must [remove profile level access](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-for-salesforce/configuration/remove-sales-insight-access.md){target="_blank"} to use this permission set.

1. Search for profiles in Quick Find and select the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** option.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL New Profile]** button at the top of the page.

   **For profiles that are allowed access [!DNL Sales Insight]**:

   * In Tab Settings, change the Marketo tabs to Default On
   * In Custom Object Permissions, check Read, Create, Edit, and Delete on [!DNL Marketo Sales Insight] Config (if the user should have access to the config settings - typically used for Admins)

   **For profiles that are not allowed access to [!DNL Sales Insight]**:

   * In Tab Settings, change the Marketo tabs to Tab Hidden
   * In Custom Object Permissions, uncheck Read, Create, Edit, and Delete on [!DNL Marketo Sales Insight] Config

## Other Changes {#other-changes}

Here are some other places where [!DNL Sales Insight] items could appear. You'll have to remove them outright since you can't use Profiles to limit their access:

* Remove [!DNL Sales Insight] buttons from Search Layouts for [!UICONTROL Contacts], [!UICONTROL Leads], and [!UICONTROL Accounts]
* Remove [!DNL Sales Insight] columns from Contact and Lead lists
