>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

## View Activities in Google Mail {#view-activities-in-google-mail}

Use the contextual Marketo Insights pane to see account information and recent activities.

The pane appears in both the full-screen compose window and as the normal Google Mail reading pane. In the compose view, the pane shows information and activities for the first person entered on the To line. In the reading view, the pane shows information and activities for the person who sent you the email youâ€™re reading.

The Person Activity tab displays relevant information about the person, such as name, title, picture, and so on. You can also see the most recent activities that have occurred after you sent an email, such as visit a webpage, fill out a form, click a link, attend an event, and open an email.

The Account Activity tab, displays relevant account information, such as company name, website URL, and location. The tab also displays the most recent account activities. The account is identified by the person domain. Activities appear in the list if any Sales Insight user in your subscription has ever corresponded with them.

If your team has never exchanged a sales email with the person, no activities appear.

Click the Marketo icon to open the pane.
