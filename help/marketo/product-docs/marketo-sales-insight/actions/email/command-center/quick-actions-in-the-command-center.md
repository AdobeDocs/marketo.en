# Quick Actions in the Command Center {#quick-actions-in-the-command-center}

There are two types of quick action columns that exist in the email grid. Email Actions, which allows you to take action on the email, and Follow Up Actions, which allows you to take engagement actions with a few quick clicks.

## Quick Actions {#quick-actions}

Email quick actions are dynamic and update depending on the most relevant actions for the status of the email you're looking at. There are a maximum of two email quick actions visible for each email status. You can see what email quick actions will be available for each status below.
