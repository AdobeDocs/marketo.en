## How Reply Tracking Works {#how-reply-tracking-works}

Reply Tracking is done by looking at a message ID that’s in every email you send. Every email contains a unique message ID that allows us to have some of the best reply tracking around.

>Connection with Email Server: Sales Connect must be connected with your inbox so we know when a new reply has arrived. You’ll need to have your Sales Connect account connected to Gmail. If you’re using Outlook, we’ll need to integrate with your exchange server.

If Sales Connect can’t track your prospect’s reply to your email, it won’t be able to stop a campaign based on reply detection or log that reply to Salesforce. What do we mean any email address can reply?

This means that if you email flynn@flynnsarcade.com and he responds with kevinf@flynnsarcade.com, we’re able to track the reply. Additionally, if you email flynn@flynnsarcade.com and CC alan@encom.com, and Alan writes you back, it will also detect the reply and end the campaign.
