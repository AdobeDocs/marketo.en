# Add an Attachment or Trackable Content to Your Email {#add-an-attachment-or-trackable-content-to-your-email}

When sending an email through Marketo Sales, you have the option of adding a file as an attachment, or making a file a downloadable (and trackable) link.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Typically, any file over 20MB will be too large to be delivered. The size of an attachment you can send via email varies depending on the email delivery channel youâ€™re using.

## Add an Attachment {#add-an-attachment}

1. Create your email draft (there are multiple ways to do this, in this example we're choosing **Compose** in the header).

## Trackable Content Updates {#trackable-content-updates}

**Trackable Content Viewer**

When a lead clicks on trackable content in your email it will open up a content viewer.

Within the content viewer leads can do the following things.

* Download the document

**Trackable Content Events in Live Feed**

When a lead clicks on the link of our doc you will see a click event. You can click on that link to view the content. As long as you're logged in to your Actions account in the browser, we will not count these clicks as events.

Each time the lead advances to another page on the doc you'll receive a Viewed event in the Live Feed that shows the name of the document.
