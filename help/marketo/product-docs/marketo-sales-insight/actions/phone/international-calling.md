# International Calling {#international-calling}

Sales Dialer makes it easy for you to communicate internationally. For customers calling from within the United States, Sales Dialer can be used for outbound calls to international countries. For customers outside of the United States, we support calling from international countries.

>[!NOTE]
>
>We generally do not support calling to international mobile numbers, and Alaska is treated as an unsupported international number.

## International Calling FAQ {#international-calling-faq}

**Why doesn't Sales Insight Actions support international calling for all countries?**

Today, we offer international calling with Sales Dialer for no additional cost. We want to make it easy for you to communicate with your own prospects and customers, therefore we’ve launched support for standard rate international calls. We provide coverage to 34 countries outside of the US and Canada for regions in Europe, Asia, and other key destinations. We will continue to expand based on feedback from customers.

**If I’m outside of the U.S., what countries can I call from and to?**

Here is the list of countries we currently do not support calls from and to. If the country you are calling from is supported, you will be able to call any other international country we support.

**Are there specific types of numbers I cannot call with Sales Dialer?**

Yes. We do not support calls to premium rate service phone numbers (such as 900 numbers in the U.S. and +449 numbers in the U.K.). In general, we do not support calling shared cost phone numbers as well as a small number of other premium routes.

**Can I use local presence when calling international?**

No. [Local presence](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/actions/phone/local-presence.md) is available for U.S. numbers only.
