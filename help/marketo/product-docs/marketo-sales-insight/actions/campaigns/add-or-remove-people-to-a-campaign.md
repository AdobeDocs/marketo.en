# Add People to your Campaign {#add-people-to-your-campaign}

There are multiple ways to add someone to a Campaign.

If you're starting communication with a prospect or customer, you can use Add to Campaign from any page in our web application, or from Salesforce.

This flow will allow you to preview, edit, and schedule your first email in the Campaign, and if your Campaign starts with a task, these tasks will get queued for you in your Tasks list in our web application and in Salesforce.

You can do this from the Campaigns tab in our web application.

You can find the Add to Campaign button on the Conversations and People pages in our web application.

If you are following up with a prospect or customer from your Gmail or Outlook inbox, you can add them to a Campaign via your compose window when you follow up with them (if the first step in the Campaign is an Email).

Just reply to their email and choose a Campaign from our plugin.

## Remove People from a Campaign {#remove-people-from-a-campaign}

You can automatically end a Campaign when a recipient replies. And, you can choose to have that mark the Campaign as a 'success' for that recipient.

To set this up, after you have created your campaign, simply check the Unsubscribe boxes in the Settings portion of the Campaigns tab. Both of these options will end the campaign and your recipient will not receive any more emails from you. You must have reply tracking for this to work.

Additionally, you can remove people from the campaign itself, remove people from a campaign within the People page, and remove an entire group of people. Let's take a look at all three methods below.

### Remove a Person Directly from a Campaign {#remove-a-person-directly-from-a-campaign}
