# Sales Campaign Settings {#sales-campaign-settings}

The Sales Campaign settings section allows you to configure a specific Sales Campaign so it can work to best fit your team's use cases for that Sales Campaign.

## Skip Weekends {#skip-weekends}

Enable skip weekends so any steps that would have fallen on a weekend day (Saturday or Sunday) will be moved to Monday.

>[!NOTE]
>
>With Skip Weekends enabled, emails will be scheduled based on a 5-day week. Meaning, when a step is scheduled, weekends will be ignored as days.
