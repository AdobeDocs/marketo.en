## Syncing [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] Tasks with [!DNL Salesforce] for the First Time {#syncing-sales-insight-ations-tasks-with-salesforce-for-the-first-time}

When you first turn on the sync between [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] and [!DNL Salesforce] tasks, we import your [!DNL Salesforce] tasks. We will not push over any current tasks you have in [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] to [!DNL Salesforce]. To reduce clutter and duplicates, the only tasks that get synced from [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] into [!DNL Salesforce] are tasks created after you sync [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] with SFDC.

Here’s what happens when you sync [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] and SFDC tasks:

As soon as you click save on tasks syncing, they begin to sync over. This will take some time initially.

Any reminders that have been updated or created in the last 24 hours will be pulled in from SFDC to [!DNL Sales Insight Actions]. The sync is based on due date and all of those tasks will get synced over on the back-end, but in Command Center, you will only see tasks due today and tomorrow.

If sync has been turned on previously and you delete any tasks in SFDC, anything that’s been deleted in the last 15 days will be deleted from Command Center.

We’ll constantly sync tasks between [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] and SFDC as long as the sync is enabled.

After the initial sync, any tasks you create, edit, complete, or delete in [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] will sync over to your tasks list in [!DNL Salesforce]. And anything created, edited, completed, or deleted in [!DNL Salesforce] will update your tasks list in [!DNL Sales Insight Actions].

To turn on this sync, just check the sync box in your [!UICONTROL Settings] page in the web application.
