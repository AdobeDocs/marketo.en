# [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] Activity Glossary {#sales-insight-actions-activity-glossary}

In [!DNL Sales Insight Actions], when a seller: adds a lead to a sales campaign, sends them a sales email, or makes an outbound sales call, it will be logged under the Marketo activity history for that lead. Additionally, when the lead engages with emails, opens, clicks, and replies, it also gets logged.

The activities below will be logged to Marketo from [!DNL Sales Insight Actions].
