>[!CAUTION]
>
>Please wait ten minutes after connecting [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] with Marketo before performing these steps.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can only do the workspace assignment once at the time of granting access to users. After it's set, you'll have to disconnect the user in order to change it.

1. If your Marketo subscription has workspaces enabled, you'll be able to assign workspaces to each user or set of users in bulk. If no workspaces are selected, weâ€™ll assign them to the Default Marketo workspace.
