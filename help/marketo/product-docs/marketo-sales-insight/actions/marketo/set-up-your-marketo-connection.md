# Set up Your Marketo Connection {#set-up-your-marketo-connection}

>[!NOTE]

>When you provision Sales Insight Actions, Marketo will automatically send your credentials to Actions and connect your instance to Marketo. This step is required **only if you are not seeing the connection established** after your Sales Connect instance is provisioned. If your connection is established, you'll see your credentials entered on the Marketo Admin Settings page and an option to disconnect.
