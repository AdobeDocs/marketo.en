# Can I Track Multiple Recipients with CC/BCC? {#can-i-track-multiple-recipients-with-cc-bcc}

You can CC and BCC individuals like you normally would on your emails.

When it comes to tracking, however, our service is unable to differentiate between who opened your email (whether it was the original recipient or the person copied). You can occasionally guess this based on the user’s location and browser, but it’s not an exact science.
