# Why Is Tracking Activity Not Showing in Salesforce Activity? {#why-is-tracking-activity-not-showing-in-salesforce-activity}

If your tracking activity isn't showing, make sure the custom activity fields that Sales Insight Actions provides are visible/editable in Salesforce. If you've installed the fields but they are not populating, there might be Field-Level Security preventing information from populating. Please check with your Salesforce Admin.
