# Why Didn't All of My Contacts Get Pushed to [!DNL Sales Insight Actions]? {#why-didnt-all-of-my-contacts-get-pushed-to-sales-insight-actions}

If only some of your contacts are pushing over, it's possible that the ones that didn't are marked as "email opt out" in your company's [!DNL Salesforce] instance.

Check the Alerts icon for detailed reasons why the whole group didn't push over. For reasons related to your company's [!DNL Salesforce] setup, please contact your SFDC administrator.
