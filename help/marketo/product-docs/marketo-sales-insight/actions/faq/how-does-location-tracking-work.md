# How Does Location Tracking Work? {#how-does-location-tracking-work}

If we got the location wrong for your recipients, here's three possibilities for what may have happened:

-If your recipient was logged in to the wireless network for a company that has its IT headquarters in another city or country, we'd log that location rather than their current locale.

-If your email was forwarded or opened by someone in the CC or BCC field, we try to accurately display the location of those people.

Overall, we'll determine locations as accurately as we can based on IP tracking, but unfortunately it isn't an exact science.
