# Can I Recover a Contact or Group I Deleted? {#can-i-recover-a-contact-or-group-i-deleted}

Unfortunately we don't have the ability to recover a contact or a group after they've been deleted. If you only deleted the group (not selected people), all of the contacts will still exist under "[!UICONTROL Everyone]" on the [!UICONTROL People] tab, so you can select them and re-add them to a new group.
