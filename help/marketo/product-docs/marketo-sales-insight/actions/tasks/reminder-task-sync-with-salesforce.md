# Reminder Task Sync with [!DNL Salesforce] {#reminder-task-sync-with-salesforce}

>[!NOTE]
>
>To learn how to enable Task Sync check out [Sync Sales Insight Actions Tasks/Reminders to Salesforce Tasks](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/actions/crm/salesforce-integration/sync-sales-activities-to-salesforce.md#sync-sales-insight-actions-tasks-reminders-to-salesforce-tasks).

Once task sync settings are enabled users will see their reminder tasks bidirectionally synced with [!DNL Salesforce]. This means users can manage tasks from either [!DNL Salesforce] or [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] and feel confident that systems will stay aligned.

## Reminder Task Field Sync {#reminder-task-field-sync}

## Syncing [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] Tasks with [!DNL Salesforce] for the First Time {#syncing-sales-insight-actions-tasks-with-salesforce-for-the-first-time}

When you first turn on the sync between [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] and [!DNL Salesforce] tasks, we import your [!DNL Salesforce] tasks. We will **not** push over any current tasks you have in [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] to [!DNL Salesforce]. To reduce clutter and duplicates, the only tasks that get synced from [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] into [!DNL Salesforce] are tasks created *after* you sync [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] with SFDC.

Here's what happens when you sync [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] and SFDC tasks:

* As soon as you click save on tasks syncing, they begin to sync over. This will take some time initially.

* Any reminders that have been updated or created in the last 24 hours will be pulled in from SFDC to [!DNL Sales Insight Actions]. The sync is based on due date and all of those tasks will get synced over on the back-end, but in Command Center, you will only see tasks due today and tomorrow.

* If sync has been turned on previously and you delete any tasks in SFDC, anything that's been deleted in the last 15 days will be deleted from Command Center.

* We'll constantly sync tasks between [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] and SFDC as long as the sync is enabled.

After the initial sync, any tasks you create, edit, complete, or delete in [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] will sync over to your tasks list in [!DNL Salesforce]. And anything created, edited, completed, or deleted in [!DNL Salesforce] will update your tasks list in [!DNL Sales Insight Actions].

To turn on this sync, just check the sync box in your [Settings page](https://toutapp.com/login) in the web application.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The subject field of a task can be updated in [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] and that update will be synced in the [!DNL Salesforce] subject field for the corresponding synced task, if you are using the `{{activity_subject}}` dynamic field in your [Activity Detail Customization](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/actions/crm/salesforce-integration/configure-salesforce-activity-detail-customization.md) settings. Conversely, any updates made to the subject field in [!DNL Salesforce] will _not_ sync over to the [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] reminder task subject field.
