# Log Emails to an External Source {#log-emails-to-an-external-source}

If your CRM provides you with a BCC address, you can use the "other" CRM section to set up email logging. Once the configuration is set up, emails that you send will automatically be logged to your CRM.

## CRMs We Integrate With {#crms-we-integrate-with}

**Almost every CRM**:

* Our auto-BCC feature works with nearly all CRMs record emails you've sent with [!DNL Sales Insight Actions] to your leads. Just make sure your CRM of choice provides you with a BCC address to take advantage of this.

**[!DNL Salesforce]**:

* We do all the above and more!

## How to Connect to Other CRMs {#how-to-connect-to-other-crms}

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Settings]**.
1. Click **CRM**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Connect]** under [!UICONTROL Other CRMs].
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Configure]**, then paste your BCC address below Email to BCC.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** and your BCC address will be saved to [!DNL Sales Insight Actions].

Emails will now be logged to your CRM via BCC.
