# Understanding the Team Tab {#understanding-the-team-tab}

In the Team Tab we highlight three important metrics.

## Emails sent with template {#emails-sent-with-template}

Of the emails that have been sent, how many of them utilized a template.

## Peak time of engagement {#peak-time-of-engagement}

Across the board we bubble up the peak time of engagement that indicates what time of day your team is getting the most activity (views, clicks, replies). Your team can schedule emails or plan to send emails strategically around this time.

## Deals closed {#deals-closed}

This is based on the sales gong and how many deals have been closed within the current month.

As a bonus, we total your team's view rate engagement. In this Tab, you can also see the Rep Leaderboard. Email stats for each person in your team are displayed here.
