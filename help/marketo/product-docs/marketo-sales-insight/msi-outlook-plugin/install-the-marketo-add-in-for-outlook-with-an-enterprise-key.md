# Install the Marketo Add-in for Outlook with an Enterprise Key {#install-the-marketo-add-in-for-outlook-with-an-enterprise-key}

Many times, sales reps don't have administrative privileges on their laptops, and their IT teams are responsible for installing all software remotely. The Marketo Add-in for Outlook can be installed this way using your Enterprise Key, which can be found in the Sales Insight section of Admin.

>**Prerequisites**

>The admin must have [issued a Marketo Email Add-In License](issue-a-marketo-email-add-in-license.md).
