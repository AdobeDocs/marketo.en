# Install the Marketo Add-in for [!DNL Outlook] with an Enterprise Key {#install-the-marketo-add-in-for-outlook-with-an-enterprise-key}

Many times, sales reps don't have administrative privileges on their laptops, and their IT teams are responsible for installing all software remotely. The Marketo Add-in for [!DNL Outlook] can be installed this way using your Enterprise Key, which can be found in the [!UICONTROL Sales Insight] section of [!UICONTROL Admin].

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>The admin must have [issued a Marketo Email Add-In License](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-outlook-plugin/issue-a-marketo-email-add-in-license.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you don't see the [!UICONTROL View Enterprise Key] button, contact [Marketo Support](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/Support/ct-p/Support) to enable it.
