# Authorize the Marketo [!DNL Outlook] Plugin {#authorize-the-marketo-outlook-plugin}

To use the Marketo MSI plugin in [!DNL Outlook], you need to authorize it.

>[!PREREQUISITES]

>The plugin must already be installed and you must be authorized as a plugin user by your Marketo Admin.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Microsoft has released a [new version of Outlook for Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/new-outlook-for-windows-now-available/ba-p/3932068){target="_blank"}. This new version does not support the existing MSI Outlook plugin. The MSI Outlook plugin will continue to work for Windows desktops running the classic version of Outlook.
