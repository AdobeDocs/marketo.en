# Setting up Stars and Flames for Lead/Contact Records {#setting-up-stars-and-flames-for-lead-contact-records}

Stars and Flames on lead/contact records are dependent upon: [!UICONTROL Lead Score], [!UICONTROL Relative Score], [!UICONTROL Urgency], and [!UICONTROL Priority] fields. These fields are available by default after you install and configure the MSI solution. If you don't have Stars and Flames, a prior setup/customization could have resulted in them being removed. Follow the steps below to add them.

1. In [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics], click the Sales drop-down and select **[!UICONTROL Settings]**. Click **[!UICONTROL Customizations]**, then **[!UICONTROL Customize the System]**.

1. In the left-side panel, click **[!UICONTROL Entities]**.

1. Find and click **[!UICONTROL Lead]**, then **[!UICONTROL Forms]**, then select the form you want to edit.
