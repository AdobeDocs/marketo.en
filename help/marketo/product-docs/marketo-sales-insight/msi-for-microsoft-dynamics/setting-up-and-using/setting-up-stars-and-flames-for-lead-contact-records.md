# Setting up Stars and Flames for Lead/Contact Records {#setting-up-stars-and-flames-for-lead-contact-records}

Stars and Flames on lead/contact records are dependent upon: Lead Score, Relative Score, Urgency, and Priority fields. These fields are available by default after you install and configure the MSI solution. If you don't have Stars and Flames, a prior setup/customization could have resulted in them being removed. Follow the steps below to add them.

1. In Microsoft Dynamics, click the Sales drop-down and select **Settings**. Click **Customizations**, then **Customize the System**.

1. In the left-side panel, click **Entities**.

1. Find and click **Lead**, then **Forms**, then select the form you want to edit.
