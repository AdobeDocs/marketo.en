# SEO - Export Issues to CSV {#seo-export-issues-to-csv}

You can export your [page issue](/help/marketo/product-docs/additional-apps/seo/pages/seo-understanding-pages.md) data to a CSV file if you'd like to share that information with people outside of Marketo. Here's how.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Pages]** section.
