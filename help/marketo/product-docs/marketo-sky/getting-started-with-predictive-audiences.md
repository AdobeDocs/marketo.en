# Getting Started with [!UICONTROL Predictive Audiences] {#getting-started-with-predictive-audiences}

Predictive Audiences (PA) utilizes AI and machine learning to enable you to target audiences more effectively and take proactive steps to reach your marketing goals.

PA includes the following features:

* [Goal Tracking and Projected Registrations](/help/marketo/product-docs/marketo-sky/understanding-goal-tracking-and-projected-registrations.md)
* AI/ML-based Insights
* Registration and Attendance Likelihood values for every lead in an event program
