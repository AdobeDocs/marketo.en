# Agent Settings {#agent-settings}

In the Calendar configuration tab, connect your Outlook or Gmail calendar for use in appointment scheduling in the chatbot.

## Connect Calendar {#connect-calendar}

Once a user's calendar is connected to Dynamic Chat, they'll be added to the queue and their calendar will be available for website visitors to schedule appointments on.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can connect one calendar per user. If you want to receive meetings on multiple calendars, you must add multiple users and have them each connect their calendars.

Users can also customize the body of the invite that's sent to the visitor when they schedule an appointment on the user's calendar. They can also select the checkbox at the bottom to include a Google Meet or Microsoft Teams link (depending on which calendar was connected).
