1. If the form is being used on a Marketo landing page, you won't be allowed to delete it. You have to go and remove it from whatever landing pages it lives on.

>If you delete a form that is being used by your public website, you won't see a warning and the form will be broken. Consider  [archiving it](/help/marketo/product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing/using-stream-content/archive-and-unarchive-stream-content.md) instead.
