## If Marketo removed this functionality from my forms on April 28, were my forms and the affected landing pages put into draft mode? {#if-marketo-removed-this-functionality-from-my-forms-on-april-were-my-forms-and-the-affected-landing-pages-put-into-draft-mode}

No, your forms that we removed this functionality from remained published.

## If [!DNL LinkedIn] was my only selected network, will this change the appearance of my form? {#if-linkedin-was-my-only-selected-network-will-this-change-the-appearance-of-my-form}

No, we will only remove the [!DNL LinkedIn] button from your form. Whenever Social Form Fill is applied to a form, there is a container created above it that contains the Social Form Fill buttons. Before April 28, 2016, if [!DNL LinkedIn] was the only option, the container's appearance resembled this image:

After April 28, 2016, there is now an empty container left at the top of any form where [!DNL LinkedIn] Social Form Fill has been removed:

>The above images are for example only. This may not be exactly how your Social Form Fill button container render. Any font color, style, etc. you have chosen influence what your container looks like.

## If [!DNL LinkedIn] was my only selected network, how can I remove the empty container above my form? {#if-linkedin-was-my-only-selected-network-how-can-i-remove-the-empty-container-above-my-form}

You can remove the empty container by editing the form, selecting [!DNL Facebook] or [!DNL Twitter] as an option for Social Form Fill, then de-selecting [!DNL Facebook] or [!DNL Twitter] as an option for Social Form Fill. This will reset the social options within the form fill container and remove it from your form.
