   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you select "Enable continuous audience sync," Marketo keeps the list up-to-date in the chosen Ad Network as the list changes in your Marketo instance. We both add **and** remove people from the audience if theyâ€™re added to/removed from the static list.

1. And that's it! Click **OK** to exit.
