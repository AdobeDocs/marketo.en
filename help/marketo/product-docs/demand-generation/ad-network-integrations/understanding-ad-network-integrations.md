## How Ad Network Integrations Work {#how-ad-network-integrations-work}

Ad network integrations connect Marketo's unique audience data to your paid media systems so you can run more targeted, personalized digital ad campaigns. These integrations currently work with [!DNL Facebook], [!DNL LinkedIn], and Google.

Capabilities include:

* Sending audiences to paid media systems in order to target known prospects with personalized display ads to nurture or reactivate them

    * Segment by buyer stage, engagement level, and more
    * Expand audiences to improve acquisition
    * Target email subscribes and non-responders with ads
    * Nurture across channels, for example, email and digital ads

* Ingesting leads or data from paid media systems into Marketo

    * For example, a [!DNL Facebook] user clicks a Subscribe button and provides a name and email address

* Uploading offline conversion data to paid media systems, optimizing lead acquisition and nurture efforts

    * For example, a person searches, sees and clicks an ad, then fills out a form online. After that, he receives a demo offline and becomes a CRM opportunity. That's where the advertiser targets him

* Retargeting of website visitors, using [Web Personalization](/help/marketo/product-docs/web-personalization/understanding-web-personalization/web-personalization-overview.md){target="_blank"}, to drive them back to your website

    * Personalize by segment or vertical
