1. You're now authorized! Select a matching mode and click **[!UICONTROL Create]**.

   >[!NOTE]

   >**[!UICONTROL Basic Matching]** uses only email addresses. **[!UICONTROL Advanced Matching]** uses seven additional fields, which increases the match rate, for more conversion.

   Great job! You can now go over to any static or smart list in Marketo and send audience data over to [!DNL Facebook].

   >Oh, before you go, be sure to [Accept [!DNL Facebook]'s Custom Audiences Terms](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos.php) within your [!DNL Facebook] account! Without doing this, the audience updates will fail.
