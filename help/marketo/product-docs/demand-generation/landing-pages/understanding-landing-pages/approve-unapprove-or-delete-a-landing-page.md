# Approve, Unapprove, or Delete a Landing Page {#approve-unapprove-or-delete-a-landing-page}

Landing pages are in draft mode until you approve them. Approval makes pages available in the rest of the system. When you edit an approved landing page, Marketo saves the draft, but continues to use the approved version until you approve the draft.

## Approve a Landing Page {#approve-a-landing-page}

1. Select a landing page, go to **[!UICONTROL Landing Page Actions]** and click **[!UICONTROL Approve]**.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can [approve multiple pages at once](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/landing-pages/landing-page-actions/approve-multiple-landing-pages-at-once.md) to make your life easier.
