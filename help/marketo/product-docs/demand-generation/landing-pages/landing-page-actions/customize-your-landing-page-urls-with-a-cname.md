# Customize Your Landing Page URLs with a CNAME {#customize-your-landing-page-urls-with-a-cname}

Even though Marketo hosts your landing pages, the URL can be totally customized. What it looks like without a CNAME:

`https://na-sj02.marketo.com/lp/mktodemoaccount126/UnsubscribePage.html`

The way it should look:

`https://go.YourCompany.com/UnsubscribePage.html`

## Choose a CNAME {#choose-a-cname}

Pick a word to go at the beginning of the URL for your landing pages. It's just one word and should be relatively short. Examples:

* go.YourCompany.com/NameOfPage.html
* info.YourCompany.com/NameOfPage.html
* pages.YourCompany.com/NameOfPage.html

The one word (plus YourCompany.com) is called a CNAME. You'll need this later so make a note of it.
