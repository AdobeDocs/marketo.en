# Create a Free-form Landing Page Template {#create-a-free-form-landing-page-template}

Free-form landing pages require less technical knowledge than their guided counterparts. To create a template for future landing pages, follow the steps below.

1. Go to **Design Studio**.

   >Select **Validate Mobile Compatibility** to make sure your code is compatible with mobile devices.
