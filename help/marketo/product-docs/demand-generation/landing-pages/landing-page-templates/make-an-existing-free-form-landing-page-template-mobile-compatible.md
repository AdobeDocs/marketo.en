## What Makes a Template [!UICONTROL Mobile Compatible]? {#what-makes-a-template-mobile-compatible}

   Great questions! Your template must have have the following tags:

   `Must have <!DOCTYPE HTML> Must have a <HEAD> element Must have a <TITLE> in the <HEAD> element Must have <META CHARSET="UTF-8"> within the <HEAD> element Must have a <BODY> element that contains one (and only one) <DIV class="mktoContent"></DIV>`  

   If everything looks good, you'll see this message.
