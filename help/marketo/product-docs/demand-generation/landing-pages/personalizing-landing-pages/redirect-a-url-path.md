   >Remember, you can only redirect URLs that start with your Marketo [CNAME](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/landing-pages/landing-page-actions/customize-your-landing-page-urls-with-a-cname.md).

1. Type the URL path (or specific page) you want to redirect in the second **[!UICONTROL Original URL]** field on the right.

   You can [use Marketo landing pages](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/landing-pages/landing-page-actions/redirect-a-marketo-landing-page-to-another-page.md) as the destination too.

Congratulations! You've successfully redirected your URL path.
