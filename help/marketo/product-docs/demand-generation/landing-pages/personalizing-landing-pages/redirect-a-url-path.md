   >Remember, you can only redirect URLs that start with your Marketo [CNAME](../../../../product-docs/demand-generation/landing-pages/landing-page-actions/customize-your-landing-page-urls-with-a-cname.md).

1. Type the URL path (or specific page) you want to redirect in the second **Original URL** field on the right.
