# Add SSL to Your Landing Pages {#add-ssl-to-your-landing-pages}

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption lets you make all of your landing pages for a Marketo instance secure.

When you fill out a web form or visit a landing page that's hosted by Marketo, by default the information is sent over non-secure protocol (HTTP). Per your company's policy, you may want to secure the information submitted to Marketo over (HTTPS). For example, when you visit `http://info.mydomain.com/` it will now be `https://info.mydomain.com/`.

Marketo tracks "Visited Web Page" and "Click Link on Web Page" by default over non-secure HTTP protocol. If you want to have your tracking links secured with their own certificate, you need to have Marketo build a separate non-shared server to enable it. To secure all aspects of a contact's interaction with you typically means securing both landing pages and tracking links.

In late 2022, changes were made to how Landing Page and tracking link domains are secured. [Learn about them here](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/product-blogs/changes-to-marketo-engage-secured-domains-platform/ba-p/329305){target="_blank"}.

If you would like SSL for your Marketo Engage Landing Pages, please contact the Adobe Account Team (your account manager).
