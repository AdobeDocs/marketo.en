Note: 

SSL Certificate column in the listing will show SSL certificate status for all the domain alias created after this feature is released. If you have got the SSL enabled for a domain through support then respective SSL certificate will continue to exist but this table only reflects SSL certificates for domain added using this feature 

It can take upto 3 mins for SSL to be in READY state, and one needs to refresh the page for changes to propagate on UI.
