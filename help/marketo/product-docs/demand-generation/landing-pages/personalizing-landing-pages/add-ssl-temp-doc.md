>* The SSL Certificate column in the listing shows certificate status for all the domain alias created after this feature is released (DATE). If you had the SSL enabled for a domain through Marketo Support, the certificate will continue to exist, but won't show in the table. This table only reflects SSL certificates for domains added using the steps in this article.
