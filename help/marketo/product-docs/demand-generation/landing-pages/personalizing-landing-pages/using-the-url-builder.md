   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you do not see any fields available in the builder, ensure that your form has hidden fields and that they are [set to accept URL Parameters](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/forms/form-fields/set-a-hidden-form-field-value.md#url-parameter).

Great work! You can now copy and paste the URL and use it on the web.
