Nice! Put any scripts or CSS you want in there.

>[!TIP]
>
>Whenever possible, test your custom HTML source in a local environment before deploying it in a landing page.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If your custom HTML is non-rendering (such as an invisible JavaScript function or CSS), put the element in a memorable location like the top left. The element outline is only visible when you click in its area.
