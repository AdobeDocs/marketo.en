   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The **Create New** feature appears only in Marketing Activities; it's not available in Design Studio. Only already-created videos are available in Design Studio. However, you can create a video share _inside a program_ by selecting **New** > **New Local Asset**. You can then select it from the drop-down, as shown here.

1. Enter the URL of the YouTube video, then name your video. Under the Clone From drop-down select **None**, then click **Insert**.

>To save time, you can use the **Clone From** option to copy all settings from an existing video share.

Congratulations! You have added a video share to your free-form landing page. Approve the landing page and your video share is live. You can also [publish the landing page to Facebook](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/facebook/publish-landing-pages-to-facebook.md) or [put the video share on your web site](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/social/social-functions/deploy-social-on-your-website.md).
