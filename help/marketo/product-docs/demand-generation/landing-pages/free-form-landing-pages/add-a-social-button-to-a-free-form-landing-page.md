   Once your landing page is active, see the activity generated by your _social button (with Analytics) on the Social Dashboard_.

   If you add a [!UICONTROL Like/Recommend Button (Lite)] instead, see the number of shares in the [landing page performance report](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/landing-pages/understanding-landing-pages/landing-page-performance-report.md).

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Create New]** from the drop-down menu.

1. Name your social button, select **[!UICONTROL None]** from **[!UICONTROL Clone From]**, and click **[!UICONTROL Insert]**.
