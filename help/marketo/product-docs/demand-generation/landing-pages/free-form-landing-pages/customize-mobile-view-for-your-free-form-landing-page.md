The mobile view of your free-form landing page is mostly automatic, but you can customize it. Here's how.

1. Select your free-form landing page.

## Mobile vs. Desktop View {#mobile-vs-desktop-view}

Under Page Elements, you'll see a ![](assets/image2015-1-22-18-3a39-3a53.png) (desktop) icon and a ![](assets/image2015-1-22-18-3a40-3a31.png) (mobile) icon. This allows you to show/hide different elements dynamically.

By default, everything on the desktop view is shown on the mobile view.

>Rectangles aren't shown on the mobile view.

## Important Things to Know: {#important-things-to-know}

* Images will expand to the width of your mobile device. If you want smaller images, pull in the rich-text element and add your image from there.
* Only use Forms 2.0 forms. They are responsive and will adjust automatically.
* Only one template element is editable, BODY#bodyid (Mobile). You can use this to change the background color.

Have fun!
