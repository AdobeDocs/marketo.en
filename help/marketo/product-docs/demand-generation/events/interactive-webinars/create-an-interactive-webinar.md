1. Give your webinar a title. Set its maximum audience size and how long it will last.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* The webinar's title is visible to participants when they join. It is important that the title is different from the name of the Interactive Webinars Event Program in your Marketo Engage instance, as well as the name of the webinar room.
   >
   >* You cannot reuse a webinar title. Each one must be unique in your Marketo instance.
   >
   >* You can change the webinar title at a later stage, if desired.
   >
   >* If you create a test webinar, it needs to be deleted before its start time to ensure that the license for that webinar does not get utilized.

1. Schedule the date/time of your webinar and click **Create**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>It is recommended that two consecutive events are spaced out by 30 minutes (unless the license supports concurrent webinars) as a buffer in case the previous webinar runs beyond its scheduled time.

Now, it's time to [design your webinar](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/events/interactive-webinars/designing-interactive-webinars.md){target="_blank"}.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>It is highly recommended that you design your webinar _before_ adding presenters or co-hosts.
