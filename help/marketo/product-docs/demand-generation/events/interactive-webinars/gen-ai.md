## Things to note {#things-to-note}

* Deleting or merging chapters only affects the chapter stack, not the video content itself. These actions are irreversible

* The GenAI features are flexible and can be used with various web page editors, not just the ones in Marketo Engage.

* Always preview your changes to ensure desired functionality and appearance.

* Deleting the webinar also deletes the GenAI content.

* For further clarification or a data deletion request, contact the Adobe Account Team (your Account Manager), or send an email to: `marketo-webinar-genai-alerts@adobe.com`.
