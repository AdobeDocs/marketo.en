>[!NOTE]
>
>If the webinar has not been completed or the data has not been received for any reason, the Dashboard tab will not yet be available.

## Manual Sync {#manual-sync}

Interactive Webinars allows you to obtain your webinar's engagement data from Adobe Connect if you haven't automatically received it within two hours of the webinar's completion. Thirty one days after the Interactive Webinar delivery date, a "Sync On-Demand Activity" options appears on the right side of the header the webinar's _Dashboard_. Clicking it triggers a pull from Adobe Connect to populate the data in Marketo Engage. It syncs data from the date of your webinar until the date you click **Sync On-Demand Activity**.

## Dashboard Widgets {#dashboard-widgets}

The Dashboard consists of four widgets.

**Event Program Status**: Shows the various program statuses for that event and the number of members of the program that are currently holding that program status value.

**Attendance**: Highlights the attendance duration of various members who have attended the webinar in comparison to the overall webinar duration in terms of percentage.

**Poll Performance**: Displays various polls launched during the webinar powered by Adobe Connect and the distribution of the members who have attended and responded to the poll across each of the answers.

**Click and File Download Activity**: Provides the download count of file and weblinks clicked during the webinar powered by Adobe Connect by various members who have attended the webinar and taken that specific action.
