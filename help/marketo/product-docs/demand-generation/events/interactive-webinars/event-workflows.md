# Event Workflows {#event-workflows}

Intro.

Interactive Webinar Dashboard is a view for marketers to view the aggregated performance of the webinar conducted in Adobe Connect. This can be seen in a separate tab named "Dashboard" that appears post the event is complete and the data is obtained from Adobe Connect. If the event has not been conducted or the data has not been received for any reason, the "Dashboard" tab would not appear on the Interactive Webinar Event Program screen. The widgets in the Dashboard cannot be drilled into or exported at this point in time.

The Dashboard consists of 4 widgets:

1. Event Program Status:

   The Event Program Status widget highlights the various program status for that event and the number of members of the program that are currently hold that program status value.

1. Attendance:

   The Attendance widget highlights the attendance duration of various members who have attended the webinar in comparison to the overall webinar duration in terms of percentage.

1. Poll Performance:

   The Poll Performance widget highlights various polls launched during the webinar in Adobe Connect and the distribution of the members who have attended and responded to the poll across each of the answers.

1. Click and file Download Activity:

   The Click and File Download Activity highlights the count of downloads of file and weblinks clicked during the Webinar in Adobe Connect by various members who have attended the webinar and taken that specific action.
