# Interactive Webinars Overview {#interactive-webinars-overview}

The Interactive Webinars feature is our built-in webinar platform inside Marketo Engage. No additional tools or integrations required.

## What is Interactive Webinars? {#what-is-interactive-webinars}

Interactive Webinars augment the existing Events and Webinars experience by providing a native and seamless experience for you to create, manage, and deliver events within Marketo Engage. When you [create an Interactive Webinar](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/events/interactive-webinars/create-an-interactive-webinar.md){target="_blank"}, multiple prebuilt meeting templates are available to choose from, all of which are customizable (you can also create and use custom templates). Attendees can share computer screens/files, chat with one another, broadcast audio and video, and participate in interactive online activities.

Interactive Webinars offers [three different licenses](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/events/interactive-webinars/user-and-license-management.md){target="_blank"}, each with various functions and capacities.

After the webinar, access [event performance analytics](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/events/interactive-webinars/event-workflows.md){target="_blank"} via reports and dashboards containing lead and aggregate engagement data. Interactive Webinar-specific filters and triggers allow you to find specific groups of people that took specific actions (e.g., clicked a link, downloaded an asset, and more).
