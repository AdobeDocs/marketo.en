## Design Elements {#design-elements}

**Template**: Structure provided to a room based on the objective of the webinar being delivered. For example, if you want to schedule a product showcase webinar, screen sharing would be an essential component to showcase the demo. The template ensures that the essential components required for an effective delivery of a particular type of webinar are in place during the configuration of the webinar room.

**Layout**: Refers to various ways that the multiple components required to ensure the success of the webinar are arranged in a particular template. A single template can have multiple layouts for you to choose from. The essential components of the webinar would remain the same across templates. The arrangement you selected would be best suited to the style/needs of you or the presenter delivering the webinar.

**Pod**: A component inside a template that performs a particular activity during the webinar. For example, setting up and delivering a poll to capture participants' responses in one activity that can be fulfilled by a poll pod. Similarly, chatting with the participants to convey a message or casually interacting with them can be an activity delivered through the chat pod. Multiple other pods are available, such as Share, Notes, Video, Chat, Attendee List, Files, Web Links, Polls, and Q & A.
