# Testing an Interactive Webinar {#testing-an-interactive-webinar}

Interactive Webinars involves the use of Adobe Connect as a webinar provider tool. It is best practice to create a test webinar before hosting your first live one.

## Workflow {#workflow}

Any Interactive Webinar can be used as a test webinar. The test can be performed by adding no more than 10 hosts and presenters (participants).

The workflow to create a test webinar remains the same as [creating any other webinar](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/events/interactive-webinars/create-an-interactive-webinar.md) in terms of the Interactive Webinar Event Program. It is recommended that the date chosen for delivery is set far in the future. 

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If you set the date and time for your test webinar too near in the future and that date/time elapses, Interactive Webinars considers the webinar delivered and would deduct one credit from your license.

One credit will be blocked for the test webinar, but it can be utilized by either rescheduling the program to use with an actual webinar or simply by deleting the test webinar program. 

After creating and designing the webinar, the host, co-host and/or presenters can join to rehearse the delivery. External invitees can also be added as co-hosts to be able to participate in the testing. The testing can be performed the same way as the webinar is delivered, so evaluators get a sense of how the webinar will go in front of an actual audience. All functionalities in the live webinar would be available in the test webinar as well. This can be performed up until 15 minutes prior to the webinar's start time.

## Features not available when testing {#features-not-available-when-testing}

Since this is a test webinar, there are few things that are not available to you that normally would be after a live webinar. This includes: recording the webinar, obtaining the engagement insights for the webinar in the form of Engagement Dashboard, or the aggregated dashboard in the Dashboard tab. The On-Demand Webinars tracking for Interactive Webinars, which is available for recorded webinars, won't be available either. Since no engagement data is tracked during the test webinar, no data will be received back from Adobe Connect to Marketo Engage, thus no post-webinar nurturing can be performed.
