# Testing an Interactive Webinar {#testing-an-interactive-webinar}

Interactive Webinars involves the use of Adobe Connect as a webinar provider tool. It is best practice to create a test webinar before hosting your first live one.

Any Interactive Webinar can be used as a test webinar. The test can be performed by adding no more than 10 hosts and presenters (participants).

The workflow to create a test webinar remains the same as [creating any other webinar](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/events/interactive-webinars/create-an-interactive-webinar.md) in terms of the Interactive Webinar Event Program. It is recommended that the date chosen for delivery is set far in the future. 

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If you set the date and time for your test webinar too near in the future and that date/time elapses, Interactive Webinars considers the webinar delivered and would deduct one credit from your license.

STOPPING HERE

To avoid this, create an Interactive Webinar far in the future and have just 1 credit blocked. This credit can be utilized by either rescheduling the program to use it for an actual webinar by moving it to the desired date or simply deleting the webinar program. 

After creating and designing the webinar, the host, co-host and/or presenters can join the webinar to rehearse the delivery. One can also add external invitees as co-hosts to the webinar to be able to participate in the testing. The testing can be performed the same way as how the webinar is delivered so that the evaluators get a flavor of how the webinar will be delivered in front of the actual audience. All the functionalities in the live webinar would be available in the test webinar as well. This can be performed until 15 minutes before the webinar. It is recommended that the host reschedules or deletes the webinar in order to not lose an Interactive Webinar credit from the license. 

Since this is a test webinar, there are few things that are available post the live webinar that would not be available for testing. This includes recording the webinar, obtaining the engagement insights for the webinar in the form of Engagement Dashboard or the aggregated dashboard in the Dashboard tab. The On-Demand Webinars tracking for Interactive Webinars, which is available for recorded webinars, wont be available as well. Since no engagement data is tracked during the test webinar, no data will be received back from Adobe Connect to Marketo and no nurturing can be performed post the webinar.

The intention behind making the process of having the test webinar available is that marketers can test the workflow from creation to delivery and then use one of the credits to deliver a live webinar to explore additional features that have been listed above.
