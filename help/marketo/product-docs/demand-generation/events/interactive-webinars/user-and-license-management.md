Marketo Admins can view (not edit) the licenses by following the steps below. Contact the Adobe Account Team (your Account Manager) to obtain additional licenses.

**Things to Note**

* The type "Additional Storage License" just provides storage, therefore the value in every field _besides_ Storage Capacity will be listed simply as "-".

* The type "Shared Room License" has unlimited events and "Additional Storage License" just provides storage, so the Total Events field for these licenses will be listed simply as "-".

* Every time an event is created, it will count as "consumed" from its respective license (unless it's a Shared Room License). Preference will be given to "Shared Event License" if there are both "Shared Event License" and "Shared Room License" of the same capacity. If the event has not been delivered and if the Event Program is deleted before the scheduled time, the event count is replenished by subtracting an event from Events Consumed.

* Once a license has been exhausted, its tile remains on the Interactive Webinars screen in the Admin section with "Total Events" and "Events Consumed" having the same value. Only when the license expires will it be removed from the screen.
