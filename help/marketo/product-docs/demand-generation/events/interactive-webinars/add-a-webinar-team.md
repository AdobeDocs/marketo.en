After creating your Interactive Webinar, you have the option to add a co-host or presenter.

## Add a Co-host {#add-a-co-host}

1. In the Overview page, click **Add co-hosts**.

SCREENSHOT

Upon clicking **Add co-hosts**, you will be prompted to add either an internal or an external user. If you select internal, you can select the desired user from the list of all users who've been added as Interactive Webinars users in Marketo Engage. If you select external, you'll be prompted to add their first name, last name, and email ID (similar to the process of adding a presenter). You can also obtain the joining URLs for both internal and external users to be shared with them.

After adding a Webinar Team, you can click the copy icon next to each user to copy (then share) their joining URLs.

## Add a Presenter {#add-a-presenter}

Upon clicking **Add presenters**, you'll be prompted to enter their first name, last name, and email address. This info will be made available to Adobe Connect during webinar delivery so the appropriate details can be auto-populated without the user having to enter them during the entry for webinar delivery. A joining URL is populated for all presenters and can be shared by the creator.
