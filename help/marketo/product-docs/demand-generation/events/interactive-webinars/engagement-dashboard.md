# Engagement Dashboard {#engagement-dashboard}

Interactive Webinars powered by Adobe Connect uses various pods to engage participants in chat, questions and answers, quizzes, and polls. The engagement dashboard allows you to track key metrics and data visualizations.

See a consolidated view of participant activities, interactions, and engagement during an event. As a host, you can view the performance of live and on-demand events and download various reports after the session. Additionally, post-webinar reports generated from the dashboard are used to evaluate the session's effectiveness, inform future content, and improve the overall webinar strategy.

The dashboard tracks various metrics, including poll responses, chat activity, and video interactions, offering valuable insights into participants' preferences and behaviors. It provides a comprehensive overview of participants' activity and engagement levels, allowing hosts to monitor real-time attendance, participation, and interactions.

View the engagement for the following types of sessions in an interactive webinar.

* **Live session**: A real-time online session where participants can actively engage with one another. 
* **On-demand session**: The recording of the live event is made available as an event of its own. New invitees can register and watch the recording. After registration, they'll receive an event joining link, which takes them to the recording of the event after it ends. Participants registered for the live event can also view the recording using the same joining link.

## Participant engagement level {#participant-engagement-level}

Organizations use Adobe Connect to deliver highly customized, branded, and engagement-led webinars. Interactive tools like polls, chat, Q&A, and reactions help engage attendees and collect more than just registration and attendance data. After attendees engage with these interactive features, the engagement data is used to classify attendees into three engagement levels: high, medium, and low. Marketers can use the engagement level to update audience segments, update lead scores, and alert sales.

Understand the criterion for classifying the engagement level for each participant:

<table><thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Engagement level</th>
    <th>Classification criterion</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>High</td>
    <td>Participants who meet all of the following criteria:
    <li>The duration of attendance is at least 80% of the total event time.</li>
    <li>All multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and multiple-answer (MA) polls are answered, at least one file is downloaded, or the number of chats posted is five or more.</li>
    <li>The attendee has asked at least one question in the Q&A pod.</li></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>Participants who meet all of the following criteria:
    <li>The attendee's engagement level isn't determined to be high.</li>
    <li>The duration of attendance is at least 60% of the total event time.</li>
    <li>At least one of the following actions has been performed by the attendee:
    <ul>
    <li>Answered at least one poll.
    <li>Asked at least one question in the Q&A pod.<li>Downloaded at least one file.
