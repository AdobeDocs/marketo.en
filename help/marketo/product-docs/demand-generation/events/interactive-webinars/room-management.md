### Rooms {#rooms}

An interactive webinar room is a virtual space designed to host live, engaging, online events where participants can interact with the presenter and other participants. In these rooms, you can find the uploaded content and recordings from webinars.

To view the list of all your rooms, select **[!UICONTROL Rooms]** from the top menu bar. You can find all the rooms you created along with uploaded content and recordings in these rooms. You can also view the number of recordings, in-room file size, and last accessed date for respective rooms.

    <td>View the number of recordings available in a room.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>In-room file size</td>
    <td>View the combined file size of content and recordings available in a room.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Last accessed on</td>
