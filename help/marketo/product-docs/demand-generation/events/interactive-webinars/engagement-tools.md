## Beyond the Basics {#beyond-the-basics}

### Managing Breakouts {#managing-breakouts}

Breakout rooms are sub rooms that can be created within a meeting or training session. They are useful for splitting a large group into smaller groups that can talk or collaborate. Hosts can create up to 20 breakout rooms for a single session.

In the breakout rooms, the attendees can speak, share their webcam, use chat pod, collaborate on a whiteboard, and share their screens. The host can visit all the Breakout rooms to assist and answer questions.

When work in the breakout rooms is complete, the host can end the breakout session and return attendees to the main room. Hosts can share and review what happened in the breakout rooms with everyone. If you use the room again, you can also reuse the breakout room layout and content.

To know more about breakout rooms, check out the videos in this playlist.

### Clear content from pods {#clear-content-from-pods}

The Clear content from pods option in the PODs menu can be used to clear the content from inside the pods when reusing the room for a new session. This will clear the content from within the room only. The interactions data from the past session is NOT deleted and will continue to be available in Marketo for analysis.

### Renaming pods {#renaming-pods}

Some pods like Notes, Chat, Files, Web Links and Share can have multiple instantiations in a room and it is possible to reuse an instance of pod in multiple layouts. By default, when multiple instances of a specific type of pod are created, a number is added as a suffix to the name to help distinguish between the different instances. However, hosts can rename such pods easily.

To rename a pod, simply double-click the name in the pod title and type in a new one. Check out this video which illustrates this.

### Switching pods {#switching-pods}

There is an easy way for hosts to switch between pods while staying in the same layout. To switch layout, click on the dropdown icon in the pod title and make a selection. The change will be reflected instantly to the participants. This option will be available on all pods which support multiple instances - Chat, Notes, Poll, Share, File share, Weblinks, and Quiz.
