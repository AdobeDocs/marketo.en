## Invite (Batch Campaign)  {#invite-batch-campaign}

* **Smart List** - Define whom you will invite to the event.
* **Flow**

  * Send Email - If this is a local asset email, it will have the following naming convention: EventName.EmailName. You can also use global emails.
  * Change Status in Progression - Set to Webinar > Invited.

* **Schedule** - Set the date for the invitation to be sent.

## Registration/Confirmation (Trigger Campaign) {#registration-confirmation-trigger-campaign}

* **Smart List**

  * Trigger the campaign based on **[!UICONTROL Fills Out Form]**. Be sure to include the landing page that the form lives on by using **[!UICONTROL Add Constraint]**, especially if the form is used on multiple landing pages.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>You must use a Marketo form to register people for the event, or a non-Marketo form with the proper API integration to push registration data to Marketo. This is critical to the success of your [!UICONTROL Event Partner] integration. **NOTE**: If you are using a Marketo form on a non-Marketo landing page, your trigger will be **[!UICONTROL Fills Out Form]** with the [!UICONTROL Form Name].

* **Flow**

  * **Change Status in Progression** - Set to Webinar > Registered. **CAUTION**: This flow step is required when setting up your child campaign. When a personâ€™s progression status changes to **Registered**, Marketo pushes the registration information to ON24.

  * **Send Email** - Confirmation email (set to **Operational** so that unsubscribed people that have registered still receive it).

**NOTE**: If the person is returned with a registration error, they won't receive the email confirmation.

## Reminder (Batch Campaign) {#reminder-batch-campaign}

* **Smart List** - Filter using **Member of Program** and set the status to **Registered**.

* **Flow** - Send Email (Reminder Email).

**NOTE**: You could use a similar campaign to send a *different* follow-up email to people who were invited but who haven't registered yet.

## Follow-Up Campaign (Batch or Trigger Campaign) {#follow-up-campaign-batch-or-trigger-campaign}

* **Smart List** - Trigger based on changes in program status.

![](assets/image2015-12-22-15-3a57-3a25.png)

* **Flow** - Send Email. Use choices to send different emails based on program status.
