# Create Your Webinar Event in ON24 {#create-your-webinar-event-in-on}

After creating your webinar in ON24, you can create a Marketo event and associate it with the ON24 webinar. This allows the systems to share registration and attendance information. Make note of the URL and other information for use in your confirmation email and ICS file.

There are certain settings in the creation of your ON24 webinar that are used by Marketo and others that are only used by ON24. Marketo uses these settings:

**Title & Description **

* Event Title - The name for the webinar. This will be viewable in Marketo.
* Event Abstract (optional) - The description for the webinar. This will be viewable in Marketo.

**Date & Time **

* Live Event Start - The start date and time. This will be viewable in Marketo.
* Live End Time - The finish date and time. This will be viewable in Marketo.

Your next step is to [create an event in Marketo](create-an-event-in-marketo.md).
