>As of August 2022, ON24 no longer supports new Marketo integrations. The information in this article only applies to existing users.

A Marketo event tracks the progression of your people through a program. It pushes registration information and pulls attendance information using the ON24 adapter. The event captures the status of your people as they progress through it.

Here's how the data is exchanged:

When you create the Marketo event, select **Webinar** as the Channel type. You can edit this channel in Admin, as well as create a new channel. If you create a new channel, it must be of the type **Event with Webinar** for the integration to work. See [Create a Program Channel](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/tags/create-a-program-channel.md) for more information.

Your next step is to [configure event settings and sync Marketo with your webinar](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/events/create-an-event/create-an-event-with-the-marketo-on24-adapter/configure-event-settings-and-sync-marketo-with-your-webinar.md).
