First create your Webinar in [!DNL Level 3]. If you need help, check out the [[!DNL Level 3] Resource Library](https://www.level3.com/en/resource-library/). You'll find it to be very similar to [!DNL BrightTalk].  Marketo uses a small subset of [!DNL Level 3] fields:

* **Name** - The name of the webcast.
* **Start Date** - The start date for the webcast.
* **End Date** - The end date for the webcast.
* **Time Zone** - The time zone set for the webcast.
* **Description** - The webcast description.
