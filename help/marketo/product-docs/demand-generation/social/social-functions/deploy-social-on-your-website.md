You can deploy social apps on your own website to engage your audience and bring everyone into the larger conversation on social networks. As people share your promotions and content with their friends on social networks, you generate more traffic on your site.

1. Select an approved social app, such as a YouTube Video or Social Button.

1. If you need to set the size of the social app to specific dimensions on your page, add the **outerHeight** and **outerWidth** options to the second code snippet. For example, you can add `options='{"outerHeight":400, "outerWidth":600}'`, as in:

   Your Marketo social app now adds content and interactivity to your website, inviting fans, visitors, and existing customers to spread the word about you. At the same time, it adds their profile data to your database and tracks social influence metrics.
