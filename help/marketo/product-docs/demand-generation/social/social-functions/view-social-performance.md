    * **Campaign Visits**: The number of times that prospects load a page that contains your social app.
    * **Interactions**: The number of times prospects have interacted with your social app, such as signing up for a [referral offer](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/social/referral-offers/create-a-referral-offer.md), voting in a [poll](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/social/creating-a-poll/create-a-poll.md), [sharing a video](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/landing-pages/free-form-landing-pages/add-a-video-to-a-free-form-landing-page.md), etc.
    * **Shares**: The number of times prospects share a message to their social network from your social app.
    * **Resulting Clicks**: The number of times prospects clicked links in shares from your social app.
    * **Registration**: The number of prospects who sign up for your promotion after following a shared link back to your app.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Visits to a page with multiple social apps count as one visit to each. Visits to multiple pages within the same app count as one visit. Visits after more than 30 minutes, or a browser restart, are counted as new.
