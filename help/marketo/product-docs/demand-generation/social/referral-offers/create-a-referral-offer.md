   >[!TIP]

   >To save time, you can use the **Clone From** option to copy all settings from an existing referral offer.

   The referral offer editor opens in a new window. The default settings are all good, but you need to add a link to your offer's rules (terms and conditions). The link will appear in the bottom of share message screens. We'll show you how in the next step.

1. Click **Advanced Options**.
