The poll editor opens in a new window. The default settings are all good, but you still need to add your poll entries. We'll show you how in the next steps.

>To change any of the defaults in your poll, click **[!UICONTROL Back]**. To save your work for later without approving, click **[!UICONTROL Close]**.

If there are any problems in the poll, you will be prompted to address them before the poll is approved.

>The next step is to [publish your poll](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/social/creating-a-poll/publish-a-poll.md), but you can change the settings of your poll if necessary. Start with [customizing the poll settings](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/social/creating-a-poll/customize-poll-settings.md).
