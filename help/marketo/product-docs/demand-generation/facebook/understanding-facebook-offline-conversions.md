# Understanding [!DNL Facebook] Offline Conversions {#understanding-facebook-offline-conversions}

Facebook Lead Ads campaigns generate leads and send them to Marketo for use in marketing campaigns. However, without visibility into offline conversions, the [!DNL Facebook] advertiser can't know which ads are most effective. Here's an example.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Example**
>
>[!UICONTROL Facebook Lead Ads] runs three ads.
>
>* Ad 1 generates 20 leads
>* Ad 2 generates 30 leads
>* Ad 3 generates 50 leads
>
>Based on these numbers alone, Ad 3 seems the most effective.
>
>However, when looking at data on the Marketo side, a different story develops.
>
>* Ad 1 generates 10 sales
>* Ad 3 generates 2 sales
>
>That means that Ad 1, despite generating fewer leads, had a 50 percent success rate, while Ad 3 was hardly effective at all.
>
>Without offline conversions, the advertiser would probably invest more money in Ad 3. With offline conversion data, the advertiser will more likely invest in Ad 1.
