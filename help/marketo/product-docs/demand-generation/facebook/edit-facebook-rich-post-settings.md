Marketo [social apps](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/social/social-functions/add-a-social-button-on-a-landing-page.md) allow your leads to share your landing pages with their connections on social networks such as [!DNL Facebook], Twitter, etc. [!DNL Facebook] OpenGraph tags (OG tags) allow you to specify which information from your landing page is included in [!DNL Facebook] posts.

## Select Rich Post Options {#select-rich-post-options}

You can specify the types of page information to use in the [!DNL Facebook] rich posts generated by shares from your landing page.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Facebook Message]** in the editor for your **[!DNL YouTube*]* video or social button.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >These should already exist in the page source, but for more control, you can add specific [!DNL Facebook] OG tags to your landing page.

    * Don't add rich content: Limits the [!DNL Facebook] posts from your landing page to just the main message and link.
