Marketo [social apps](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/social) allow your leads to share your landing pages with their connections on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. Facebook OpenGraph tags (OG tags) allow you to specify which information from your landing page is included in Facebook posts.

## Select Rich Post Options {#select-rich-post-options}

You can specify the types of page information to use in the Facebook rich posts generated by shares from your landing page.

1. Select **Facebook Message** in the editor for your **YouTube** video or social button.

   >These should already exist in the page source, but for more control, you can&nbsp; [add specific Facebook OG tags to your landing page](edit-facebook-rich-post-settings.md).&nbsp;

    * Don't add rich content: Limits the Facebook posts from your landing page to just the main message and link.

1. Add the HTML that defines og:title, og:caption, and og:description. Copy and paste these lines and replace the placeholder text:

   <meta property="og:title" content="My Post Title"/>  
   <meta property="og:caption" content="My Post Caption"/>  
   <meta property="og:description" content="This text appears in the post description"/>
