# Conversational Flow Overview {#conversational-flow-overview}

Design a Conversational Flow and trigger it to any visitor based on a specific action (e.g., clicking on a call-to-action button, upon page load, time spent on page, etc.).

## Dialogues vs. Conversational Flows {#dialogues-vs-conversational-flows}

While Dialogues and Conversational Flows have several similarities, they are two separate features.

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td>Dialogues are targeted&mdash;You design a conversation for a specific page and audience based on parameters you implemented.</td> 
   <td>Conversational Flows are triggered&mdash;You design a conversation that can be triggered based on a visitor's action, like filling out a form, clicking a link, etc.</td>

   <td>Only supported in the Chatbot interface.</td> 
   <td>Currently supported in a pop-up interface, with more interfaces planned.</td>

   <tr> 
   <td>Multiple Dialogues can be created for the same segment of leads, with a priority order so each visitor sees the Dialogue in sequence by priority as they continue to engage.</td> 
   <td>Conversational Flows have no priority order and can be triggered any number of times by the same lead based on the call-to-action determined.</td>

   <td>Chatbot conversations are powered by Dialogues.</td>

## Stream Designer Tab {#stream-designer-tab}

### Conversations SDK {#conversations-sdk}

In the bottom half of the Settings tab, customize the Conversation trigger, also known as Conversations SDK. You can decide if the conversation is triggered on your website when a visitor clicks any link, or upon page load.
