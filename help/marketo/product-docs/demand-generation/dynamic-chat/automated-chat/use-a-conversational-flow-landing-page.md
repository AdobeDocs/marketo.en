# Use a Conversational Flow Landing Page{#use-a-conversational-flow-landing-page}

Embedding a Dynamic Chat Conversational Flow directly into a Marketo Engage Landing Page allows visitors to schedule a meeting through Dynamic Chat without having to fill out a form or interact with a chatbot.

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>Create a simple [Conversational Flow](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/automated-chat/create-a-conversational-flow.md) that only contains a **Meeting booking** card.

## Guided Landing Pages {#guided-landing-pages}

Embed the following code in your Guided Landing Page template: `<div class="mktoConversation" id="exampleConversation" mktoName= "Example Conversation"></div>`.

Open your Guided Landing Page template in the editor and select the Conversational Flow placeholder.

Click the Conversational Flow drop-down and select the CF you created in Step 1.

Always keep Delivery Type as **In-line**. Click **Insert**.

The Conversational Flow you just entered will appear as an Element on the right.

NOTES FROM STEVE MEETING

guided lp, new div id for template, choose conv flow

freeform lp, bring over icon - caveat: add note--when you put cf on the editor, it doesn't show you a preview (no placeholder either) - "you won't see a preview" - on the sidebar they will see that the cf is on the page - guided lp lists it as an element - use "at this time" when explaining - feature goes live maybe week of 22nd
