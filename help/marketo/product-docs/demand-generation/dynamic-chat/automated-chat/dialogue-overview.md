# Dialogue Overview {#dialogue-overview}

Dialogues are individual chat conversations. In each Dialogue, you decide where the specific chat conversation is displayed, to whom it will be shown, and what the content of the conversation will be. Each Dialogue also has its own report page where you can monitor effectiveness.

## Audience Criteria {#audience-criteria}

The [Audience Criteria](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/automated-chat/audience-criteria.md){target="_blank"} section of a Dialogue is where you'll define where and to whom your chat conversation will be shown

The [Stream Designer](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/automated-chat/stream-designer.md){target="_blank"} section of a Dialogue is where you'll design the conversation that you want to have with your website visitors.
