# Configuration {#configuration}

Learn how to customize the look and feel of your chatbot dialogue window.

To get started, click **Configuration**.

There are several different customization options.

PICC (of whole chatbox)

## Style Tab {#style-tab}

**Style**

This is where you'll define the look and feel of the chatbot where your Dialogues will be shown, including: colors, fonts, placement of the bot widget, and the chatbot’s name/avatar.

Each category's color is determined by a [hexadecimal color value](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) (e.g., white = #ffffff, red = #bf1932, etc.).

PICC

The Anchor allows your site visitor to open/close the chatbox. You can choose whether you want that icon to appear on the bottom right or bottom left. You can also increase/decrease padding (the amount of space between the chatbox and the icon).
