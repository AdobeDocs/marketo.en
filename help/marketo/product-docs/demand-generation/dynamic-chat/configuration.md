Learn how to customize the look and feel of your chatbot dialogue window.

## Style Tab {#style-tab}

**Style**

Style lets you pick your desired colors, chatbox anchor position/padding, and font type/size.

Each category's color is determined by a [hexadecimal color value](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) (e.g., white = #ffffff, red = #bf1932, etc.).

PICC

The Anchor allows your site visitor to open/close the chatbox. You can choose whether you want that icon to appear on the bottom right or bottom left. You can also increase/decrease padding (the amount of space between the chatbox and the icon).
