# Generative AI in Dynamic Chat {#generative-ai-overview}

Generative AI powered capabilities in Adobe Dynamic Chat allow you to optimize productivity for your sales agents, get insights into your website visitor intent, and respond to visitor questions in a safe manner.

## Generation Response Card {#generation-response-card}

Create a message for the visitor for when they reach a certain point in the conversation. Set a number of questions they can ask in one go to achieve your desired key performance indicator. Add up to 5 follow-up questions and include a fallback message when there is no response available to a visitor's question.

## Conversation Summary {#conversation-summary}

Typically to get the full context of a visitor conversation, you must scroll through the entire chat transcript. Conversation Summary generates a summary for you in real-time, and even includes topics the visitor expressed interest in. This is particularly useful to chat agents who need quick context of a conversation when they're switching between chats with multiple visitors. In addition to being visible in the Agent Inbox chat screen, completed Conversation Summaries can also be found in the activity log of the visitor's Person Record in your Marketo Engage Database.
