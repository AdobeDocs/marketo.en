# Generative AI Overview {#generative-ai-overview}

Generative AI in Adobe Dynamic Chat processes intent signals, user preferences, and past behavior in real time to generate relevant, personalized messages for chat visitors.

## Generation Response Card {#generation-response-card}

Create a message for the visitor for when they reach a certain point in the conversation. Set a number of questions they can ask in one go to achieve your desired key performance indicator. Add up to 5 follow-up questions and include a fallback message when there is no response available to a visitor's question.

## Conversation Summary {#conversation-summary}

Typically to get the full context of a visitor conversation, you must scroll through the entire chat transcript. Conversation Summary generates a summary for you in real-time, and even includes topics the visitor expressed interest in. This is particularly useful to chat agents who need quick context of a conversation when they're switching between chats with multiple visitors.
