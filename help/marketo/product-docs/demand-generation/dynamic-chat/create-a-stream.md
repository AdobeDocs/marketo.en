# Create a Stream {#create-a-stream}

There are _many_ stream combinations to create. Below is one example where the marketer asks the site visitor if they have any questions. If yes, the visitor can schedule an appointment. If no, the visitor is given the option to join a mailing list for future correspondence. The goal is either scheduling an appointment or collecting the visitor's email.

1. After you [create your dialogue](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/dialogues.md#create-a-new-dialogue), click the Stream Designer tab.
