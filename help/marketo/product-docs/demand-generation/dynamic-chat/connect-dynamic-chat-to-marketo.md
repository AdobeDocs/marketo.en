# Connect Dynamic Chat to Marketo {#connect-dynamic-chat-to-marketo}

After you've completed the [initial setup](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/initial-setup.md){target="_blank"}, it's time to perform the one-time sync connecting Dynamic Chat to your Marketo subscription.

1. In My Marketo, click the **Dynamic Chat** tile.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you don't see the tile, reach out to your Marketo Admin.

1. If you've previously accessed an application with an Adobe ID, you'll be taken straight to Dynamic Chat. If not, [set up your Adobe ID](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/create-update-adobe-id.html){target="_blank"}.

1. To connect your Marketo instance, select **Integrations**.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >At this time, attribute selections **cannot** be changed after the initial sync. When the sync is done, you can only go back and add more (if you chose less than 50).

1. Review your selections (reminder: you cannot remove attributes post-sync, so click **Edit Selections** if you need to change any in this step). Click **Confirm** when done to initiate the sync.
