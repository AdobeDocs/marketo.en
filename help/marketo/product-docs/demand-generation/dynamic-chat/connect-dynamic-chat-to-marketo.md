# Connect Dynamic Chat to Marketo {#connect-dynamic-chat-to-marketo}

After you've completed the [initial setup](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/initial-setup.md), it's time to perform the one-time sync connecting Dynamic Chat to your Marketo subscription.

1. In My Marketo, click the **Dynamic Chat** tile.

   >If you don't see the tile, reach out to your Marketo Admin.

1. If you've previously accessed an application with an Adobe ID, you'll be taken straight to Dynamic Chat. If not, [set up your Adobe ID](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/create-update-adobe-id.html).
