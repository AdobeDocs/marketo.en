## Integrations {#integrations}

Integrations is the first tab you'll want to visit upon accessing Dynamic Chat. It's where you sync your Marketo Subscription(s), allowing you to utilize your Marketo Database data to identify site/chat visitors ([see Step 3 above](#access-dynamic-chat)).

## Dialogues {#dialogues}

Dialogues are the individual chat conversations you'll set up. You can specify who will see what for known or even anonymous visitors. [Learn more about Dialogues](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/dialogues.md).

## Configuration {#configuration}

In the Configuration tab, customize the look and feel of your various Dialogues. Change font, colors, response time, and more! [Learn more about Configuration](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/configuration.md).

## Calendar {#calendar}

In the Calendar tab, connect your (Outlook or Gmail) calendar to Dynamic Chat so site visitors can schedule appointments with your agents.

## Meetings {#meetings}

The Meetings tab is where you'll see the status of all the meetings your agents have scheduled via Dynamic Chat, as well as other related details.

## Routing {#routing}

Routing shows you the order in which agents are assigned meetings, as well as total meetings to date (per agent). Meetings go round robin style, so if you have five agents and agent three took the last meeting, agent four will get the next one, followed by five, then back to agent one.
