# Dynamic Chat Overview {#dynamic-chat-overview}

Dynamic Chat allows you to leverage an easy-to-use interface to target both leads (PEOPLE?) and accounts on their (VISITING YOUR?) website. Collect relevant content such as their name, contact information, and free text. Site visitors can also book meetings with your Sales Team. Dynamic Chat activity and engagement data can be used to add members to Marketo programs and trigger cross-channel activities.

## Integrations {#integrations}

Integrations is the first tab you'll want to visit upon accessing Dynamic Chat. It's where you sync your Marketo Subscription(s), allowing you to utilize your Marketo Database data to identify site/chat visitors ([see Step 3 above](#access-dynamic-chat)).

## Dialogues {#dialogues}

Dialogues represent a single chat engagement. Think of it as a container with all the stuff you need to have an engaging chat dialogue to your website visitors. In each Dialogue, you can specify which page(s) you’d like the Dialogue to appear on, to whom you'd like it to be shown to, and the content and flow of the Dialogue itself. Additionally, you can find metrics to see how well your Dialogue is performing. [Learn more about Dialogues](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/dialogues.md).

## Configuration {#configuration}

In the Configuration tab, customize the look and feel of your various Dialogues. Change font, colors, response time, and more! [Learn more about Configuration](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/configuration.md).

## Calendar {#calendar}

In the Calendar tab, connect your (Outlook or Gmail) calendar for use in appointment scheduling in the chatbot. Once a user’s calendar is connected to Dynamic Chat, that user will be added to the queue and their calendar will be available for website visitors to schedule appointments on.

You can also customize the body of the invite EMAIL? that is sent to the visitor when they schedule an appointment on the user’s calendar.

## Meetings {#meetings}

This is where you'll see all of the appointments that have been scheduled by website visitors through your various Dialogues. Here you’ll find the email address of the lead that booked the appointment, which agent they booked the appointment with, when the appointment is scheduled to occur, and whether the meeting has happened or not.

## Routing {#routing}

This is where you can see a list of all of the agents that have connected their calendars as well as what order they will be presented to website visitors Meetings go round robin style, so if you have five agents and agent three took the last meeting, agent four will get the next one, followed by five, then back to agent one.
