In Security settings, you have the ability to add domains to a blocked or allowed list.

## Blocked Email Domains {#blocked-email-domains}

If there are any visitors with email domains you don't want your agents to interact with (e.g., a competitor), add their email domain to the blocklist.

1. Select the **Enable Validation** slider to activate your blocklist. Enter up to 50 domains and click **Save**.

## Allowed Domains {#allowed-domains}

Adding allowed domains ensures that third parties can't scrape the javascript from your site and add it to their own.

1. Select the **Enable Validation** slider to activate your allowlist. Enter the allowed domains and click **Save**.
