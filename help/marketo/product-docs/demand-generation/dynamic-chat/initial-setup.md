1. If you've previously accessed an application with an Adobe ID, you'll be taken straight to the Adobe Admin Console. If not, [set up your Adobe ID](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/create-update-adobe-id.html).

## Add Users {#add-users}

1. After logging in to the Admin Console, the next thing to do is add users. We have that process [documented here](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/add-or-remove-chat-users.md#add-a-chat-user).

## Add Permissions in Marketo {#add-permissions-in-marketo}

After adding users in the in Admin Console, you must grant permissions in Marketo in order for them to have access to the Dynamic Chat shortcut from Marketo.

1. In Marketo, click **Admin**.

1. Find and double-click on the desired user.

1. Add **Access Dynamic Chat** and click **Save**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Be sure to follow steps in the order listed above. If someone is granted permission in Marketo first, they will see the Dynamic Chat tile but have no user access.

Next step is to [connect Dynamic Chat to Marketo](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/connect-dynamic-chat-to-marketo.md).
