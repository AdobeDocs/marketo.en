# Routing {#routing}

Meetings booked in [!DNL Dynamic Chat] can be routed two ways. Round robin, or using a custom rule.

Round robin: Meetings get assigned to agents sequentially. So if you have five agents and agent three took the last meeting, agent four will get the next one, followed by agent five, then back to agent one.

Custom rule: You can choose specific agents to receive meetings based on attributes you select.

## Create a Custom Rule {#create-a-custom-rule}

In this example we're sending all meetings from the inferred states of CA, OR, and WA to agent John.
