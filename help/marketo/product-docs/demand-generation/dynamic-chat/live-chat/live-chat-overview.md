# Live Chat Overview {#live-chat-overview}

Live chat allows website visitors to engage in real-time chat conversations with your sales agents.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For those on the Dynamic Chat Select package, live chat is a trial feature with a lifetime limit of 100 engagements. When this limit is reached, any visitors who request to chat with a live agent will not be connected and will instead receive the global fallback message. To increase the limit, please contact your Adobe Account Representative to discuss package upgrade options.

## Add Live Chat Agents {#add-live-chat-agents}

To get started with live chat, you'll need to add your live chat agents as [users in the Adobe Admin Console](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/setup-and-configuration/add-or-remove-chat-users.md#add-a-chat-user){target="_blank"} and give them the [Live Chat permission](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/setup-and-configuration/permissions.md){target="_blank"}. After this is done, you can then add a [live chat card](#using-the-live-chat-card) to a new or existing Dialogue. 

When visitors request to chat with an agent through your Dialogue, agents will have multiple [notification options](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/live-chat/agent-inbox.md#live-chat-notifications){target="_blank"}. When they click on the notification, they'll be taken to their [Agent Inbox](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/live-chat/agent-inbox.md){target="_blank"} where they can begin chatting with the visitor.

>[!NOTE]

>The live agent avatar uses the profile picture from the agent's Adobe account profile. To update the image, follow [these steps](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/edit-adobe-account-personal-profile.html){target="_blank"}.

## Using the Live Chat Card {#using-the-live-chat-card}

Use the live chat card in the [Stream Designer](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/automated-chat/stream-designer.md){target="_blank"} when you want visitors to chat with a live agent.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The live chat card must always be the last card in the branch. If the card is placed in a random point in the branch, it could surprise the visitor by suddenly connecting them to an agent.

### Best Practices {#best-practices}

* Use a question card before the live chat card asking the visitor if they'd like to connect.
* After the visitor agrees to connect, use the information capture card to collect some of their info, like first/last name, email address, job title, etc. (it's recommended to at least request first name and email address).

## Live Chat Card Options {#live-chat-card-options}

Clicking on the live chat card in the stream allows you to choose how the visitor gets routed. Choose from round robin, an agent, custom rules, or a team.

<table> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td><b>Round Robin</b></td>
   <td>Chats are assigned to agents in sequential order.</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><b>Agent</b></td>
   <td>Choose a specific agent to receive the chat.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr> 
   <td><b>Custom Rules</b></td>
   <td>All custom rules will be cycled through when considering where to route the visitor. If the visitor doesn't qualify for any custom rule, they get the <a href="/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/setup-and-configuration/agent-management.md#live-chat-fallback" target="_blank">live chat fallback message</a>.</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><b>Team</b></td>
   <td>Choose a specific team to receive the chat. If this option is chosen, it will be assigned round robin within that team.</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Live Chat Notifications {#live-chat-notifications}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>In order to receive browser notifications for live chat, all live chat agents must enable browser notifications for Dynamic Chat when prompted.

### Enabling Notifications {#enabling-notifications}

Live chat agents will see a banner at the top of the screen when they log in that reads "Please enable browser notifications to receive live chat notifications." Click **Enable**.

   ![](assets/live-chat-overview-4.png)

Live chat agents will then be prompted by the browser to show notifications. Click **Allow**.

   ![](assets/live-chat-overview-5.png)

If agents do not get browser notifications even after allowing in the browser, they may need to enable notifications for the browser in the OS notification settings:

[Steps for Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-notification-settings-in-windows-8942c744-6198-fe56-4639-34320cf9444e){target="_blank"}

### When a Live Chat is Routed to an Agent {#when-a-live-chat-is-routed-to-an-agent}

When a live chat is routed to an agent, they'll see a blue banner across the top of the screen asking them to accept, as well as a notification sound to help prevent missed notifications.

   ![](assets/live-chat-overview-3.png)

>[!TIP]
>
>You also have the option to set up browser notifications, which will alert you in case you're not logged in to Dynamic Chat.
>
>* Enable browser notifications in [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3220216?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop){target="_blank"}
>* Enable browser notifications in [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox){target="_blank"}

### Failed Action Notifications {#failed-action-notifications}

When an action such as a meeting booking or a live chat fails, users are notified via email.

   ![](assets/live-chat-overview-6.png)

### Things to Note {#things-to-note}

* Agents have 100 seconds to respond before the "Accept chat" message times out. After that, visitors will receive the [fallback message](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/setup-and-configuration/agent-management.md#live-chat-fallback){target="_blank"}. For Dynamic Chat Prime subscribers who have the routing option set to **Team**, one more agent will be tried before the fallback message appears.
* There is a limit of 10 live chats per agent at this time.
