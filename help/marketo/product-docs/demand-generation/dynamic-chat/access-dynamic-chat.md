# Access Dynamic Chat {#access-dynamic-chat}

After you've completed the [initial setup](/help/marketo/product-docs/demand-generation/dynamic-chat/initial-setup.md), it's time to sync Dynamic Chat to your Marketo subscription.

1. In My Marketo, click the **Dynamic Chat** tile.

   >If you don't see the tile, reach out to your Marketo Admin.

1. If you've previously accessed an application with an Adobe ID, you'll be taken straight to Dynamic Chat. If not, [set up your Adobe ID](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/create-update-adobe-id.html).
