# Implementing RTP on [!DNL Wordpress] {#implementing-rtp-on-wordpress}

To implement your [!UICONTROL RTP tag] please follow the installation instructions below:

1. Open up the **header.php** file of your **[!DNL WordPress] theme**.

   You can either use an FTP client to access your server or edit your theme files directly from the [!DNL WordPress] dashboard. Your file editor is located under the **[!UICONTROL Appearance]** tab in the sidebar menu.
