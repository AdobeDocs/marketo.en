   >Account Lists are synced from ABM to Web Personalization for use in Segmentation. Select them from the drop-down. The sync can take up to five minutes. It will only sync if there are one or more Named Accounts in the Account List.

1. Click **Save**, or click **Save & Define Campaign** to go to the Campaigns page.
