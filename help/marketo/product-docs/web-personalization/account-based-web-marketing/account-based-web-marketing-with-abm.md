# Account-Based Web Marketing with TAM {#account-based-web-marketing-with-TAM}

Marketo has introduced a new [Target Account Management](https://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/account+based+marketing) (TAM) application.

When you use Marketo Web Personalization and the new Target Account Management (TAM):

* TAM is the source for your Account Lists
* Account Lists are managed (created, edited, and deleted) in TAM
* Account Lists are synced to Web Personalization for use in Segmentation. Select them from the drop-down

    * **Note**: The sync can take up to 5 minutes

* In Web Personalization, you can create [segments targeting accounts from the Account List](/help/marketo/product-docs/web-personalization/account-based-web-marketing/create-a-new-account-list.md) you created in TAM, and personalize content for these accounts

## For Existing Web ABM Customers {#for-existing-web-TAM-customers}

If you're already using Web ABM:

* You can create Account Lists in Web ABM _and_ in TAM
* You can create, edit, and delete Account Lists in TAM _and_ in Web ABM
* Account Lists (from both Web ABM and TAM) are synced to Web Personalization for use in Segmentation

    * **Note**: The sync can take up to 5 minutes

* In Web Personalization, you can create segments targeting accounts from Account Lists created in _both_ Web ABM and TAM and personalize content for these accounts
* You can upload CSV files on the Web Personalization Account List page
