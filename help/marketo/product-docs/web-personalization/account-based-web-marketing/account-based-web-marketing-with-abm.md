# Account-Based Web Marketing with ABM {#account-based-web-marketing-with-abm}

Marketo has introduced a new [Account Based Marketing](http://docs.marketo.com/display/docs/account+based+marketing) (ABM) application.

When you use Marketo Web Personalization and the new Account Based Marketing (ABM):

* ABM is the source for your Account Lists
* Account Lists are managed (created, edited, and deleted) in ABM
* Account Lists are synced to Web Personalization for use in Segmentation. Select them from the drop-down

    * **Note**: The sync can take up to 5 minutes

* In Web Personalization, you can create [segments targeting accounts from the Account List](create-a-segment-using-an-account-list.md) you created in ABM, and personalize content for these accounts
