# Setting [!UICONTROL Web Personalization] to Do Not Track {#setting-web-personalization-to-do-not-track}

Web visitors can set their browser to prevent tracking by any website, by choosing "Do Not Track" (DNT). This prevents tracking for that particular browser and device.

In [!UICONTROL Web Personalization] and [!UICONTROL Predictive Content], a marketer can set a toggle to indicate whether to support or ignore the browser's Do Not Track (DNT) setting. The toggle for accounts is set to off as default, meaning the DNT is not honored by the application.

## Enable or Disable the Toggle {#enable-or-disable-the-toggle}

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Account Settings]**.

   When the toggle is set to [!UICONTROL On], Web Personalization will honor and support the browser’s Do Not Track (DNT) setting, and will not track any web activity or run any campaigns or content recommendations on your website.

   >Setting the toggle to [!UICONTROL On] might affect Marketo’s value and functionality in specific areas.

1. To disable the [!UICONTROL Honor DNT] toggle and ignore the browser’s Do No Track (DNT) setting, select **[!UICONTROL Off]** under [!UICONTROL Honor DNT].
