# Add Subdomains in [!UICONTROL Account Settings] {#add-subdomains-in-account-settings}

Here's how to add subdomains to your primary domains in [!UICONTROL Account Settings]. This will allow you to manage subdomains related to the specific RTP [!DNL Javascript] of your primary domain. It is recommended to deploy the [!DNL Javascript] tag to any added subdomains.

1. In Web Personalization, go to **[!UICONTROL Account Settings]**.
