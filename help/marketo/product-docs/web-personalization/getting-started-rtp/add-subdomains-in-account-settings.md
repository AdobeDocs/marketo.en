# Add Subdomains in Account Settings {#add-subdomains-in-account-settings}

Here's how to add subdomains to your primary domains in Account Settings. This will allow you to manage subdomains related to the specific RTP Javascript of your primary domain. It is recommended to deploy the Javascript tag to any added subdomains.

1. In Web Personalization, go to **Account Settings**.
