The four apps are:

* Web Personalization
* Account-Based Web Marketing
* Website Retargeting
* Content`<sup>AI</sup>`

The** Web Personalization **tile is your access point for** **creating personalized web campaigns.** **Account-Based Web Marketing and Web Retargeting. You can add content on the Content Analytics page.

**Account-Based Web Marketing** works with Web Personalization and features Named Accounts. The Named Accounts page provides graphical information on existing customers, total engagements, and organizational trends, as well as a list of the accounts. You can create new named accounts there as well.

**Website Retargeting** gives you the power to remarket to segmented audiences. You can set segments, but can’t use Named Accounts in the filter.

**Content`<sup>AI</sup>`** is the place to give content recommendations. You can add content easily to the Content Recommendations page.
