# Integrate with Adobe Analytics {#integrate-with-adobe-analytics}

## Intro {#intro}

Analyze your web analytics from a B2B perspective by viewing organization, industry and [!DNL Marketo Real-Time Personalization] (RTP) campaign data within your Adobe Analytics account.

This document enables the integration between [!DNL Marketo Real-Time Personalization] (RTP) and Adobe Adobe Analytics. Data from RTP will allow you to detect and analyze trends in all industry segments and organizations visiting your site and measure the effectiveness of your RTP campaigns, providing the insights and analysis to gain optimal results.

You can achieve this by looking at metrics such as the numbers of new versus returning visitors in each segment, analyzing click rates on campaigns, and discovering which industries and customized segments and real-time campaigns generated the best converting leads. Leverage this ability to gain the maximum benefit from your RTP account.

## RTP Audience Analytics {#rtp-audience-analytics}

With the RTP - AA integration, you have a new dimension within your web analytics interface. RTP automatically enhances your web analytics dashboards with:

1. Organization and industry data
1. Customized RTP segments
1. Named Account lists (Account-Based Marketing)

This enhances your B2B data and allows you to focus on relevant visitors by optimizing:

1. Outbound channels

The RTP dashboard helps you understand the breakdown of your visitors according to verticals and RTP segments. You can see your visitor performance according to the industry and different marketing campaigns (paid, organic, social) related to that industry. The dashboard also provides a high-level overview of what site sections your visitors are viewing according to their industry type.

## Behavioral Report {#behavioral-report}

Different behavior reports can be created in Adobe Analytics based on organization, industry and RTP segment data. These Flow Reports visualize the path visitors take from one Page or Event to the next. This report can help you discover what content keeps visitors engaged with your site.
