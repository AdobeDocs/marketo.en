# Prioritizing Web Campaigns {#prioritizing-web-campaigns}

Prioritize your web campaigns when two or more web campaigns overlap by setting a Priority Score.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Overlapping Campaigns**
>
>A web campaign overlap occurs when:
>
>* Two or more Widgets and/or Dialog campaigns react at the same time on the same page
>* Two or more In Zones with the same zone id react at the same time on the same web page
>
>An In Zone campaign and a (Widget or Dialog) campaign can react on the same page.

1. Go to Web Campaigns.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >To make it easier to find the web campaign you want, use the [filter feature](/help/marketo/product-docs/web-personalization/working-with-web-campaigns/filter-web-campaigns.md).

1. In the Edit Campaign Page, set the Priority Score (9999 = Highest Priority  1 = Lowest Priority).

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >We recommend that you use campaign Priority Score only if there is a potential campaign overlap, with a higher importance of one of the campaigns. You don't have to set a priority for every campaign.

1. Save or Launch the campaign.

1. See the Priority Score displayed in the Web Campaigns page.
