# Launch/Pause a Web Campaign {#launch-pause-a-web-campaign}

A web campaign is a customized reaction associated with a specific segment and can be a [dialog box](/help/marketo/product-docs/web-personalization/working-with-web-campaigns/create-a-new-dialog-web-campaign.md) on your website, an [in zone replacement](/help/marketo/product-docs/web-personalization/working-with-web-campaigns/create-a-new-in-zone-web-campaign.md), a widget feature, or an email alert.

You can launch or pause a web campaign in two ways from the Web Campaigns page or Set Web Campaigns page.
