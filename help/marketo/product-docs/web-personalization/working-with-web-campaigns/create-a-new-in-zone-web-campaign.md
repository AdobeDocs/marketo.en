# Create a New In Zone Web Campaign {#create-a-new-in-zone-web-campaign}

A web campaign is a customized reaction associated with a specific segment and can be a [dialog box](create-a-new-dialog-web-campaign.md) on your website, an in zone replacement, a [widget feature](create-a-new-widget-web-campaign.md) or an email alert. An In Zone web campaign replaces an element of your website based on the Zone id with content or graphical banners. 

## Create an In Zone Web Campaign {#create-an-in-zone-web-campaign}

   >
   >
   >A Zone ID is where you would like your "In Zone" web campaign to be located onsite. To find a "Zone ID", simply go to your website select the area you would like to replace with a web campaign and right-click. In Chrome, the option is “Inspect Element”, in other browsers it may vary.
   >
   >
   >Then, you want to find the "id" associated with this section of the website, which is highlighted because you are inspecting that element. For example, if once you right-click in Chrome the highlighted text says <div id="featured-slider"> then "featured-slider" is what you should type in the "zone id" section. Typically "div id" is used, but any ID can be used as well, such as h1 id, p id, etc.
