## Create a Dialog Web Campaign {#create-a-dialog-web-campaign}

Create a web campaign to personalize your web content in real-time and provide the right message, to the right user at the right time.

A web campaign is a customized reaction associated with a specific segment. The reaction can be a dialog box on your website, an [in zone replacement](create-a-new-in-zone-web-campaign.md), a [widget feature](create-a-new-widget-web-campaign.md)or an email alert.

1. Go to **Web Campaigns**.
