# AB Test Your Web Campaign {#ab-test-your-web-campaign}

Testing is a great way to optimize your web campaigns for better engagement. Here's how to get started.

To A/B test your personalized campaigns, you can select two or more campaigns, associate them to the same **[!UICONTROL Split Test]** group, and select **[!UICONTROL Auto Tune]** to automatically continue with the best performing campaign.

>If you'd prefer to manually calculate and see which campaign is performing better, do not enable [!UICONTROL Auto Tune].
