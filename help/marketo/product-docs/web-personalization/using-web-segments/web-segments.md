The Segments tab displays all of the custom defined segments that you set up based on various attributes.  **A segment is a collection of visitors that meet the specified criteria defined in the 'Set a Segment' page.**  A segment can be visitors from a specific industry, location or based on the visitor's onsite activity.

In [!DNL Web Personalizatio] , a visitor can match more than one segment. For example, if there is a segment for USA visitors and a segment for finance companies, a web visitor from Bank of America would match **both** the segment for USA visitor and the segment for finance companies.

**GRAPH:**  The Segments page displays a bar chart graph of the selected segments according to the number of visitors from the segment (y axis) and the segment name (x axis).
