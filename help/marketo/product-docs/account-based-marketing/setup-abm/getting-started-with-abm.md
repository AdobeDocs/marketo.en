##### Step One: * [Issue a License](issue-a-license.md)* - Decide who on your team is going to be using ABM. {#step-one-issue-a-license-decide-who-on-your-team-is-going-to-be-using-abm}

##### Step Two: *Set [Permissions](permissions.md)* - Assign specific aspects of ABM to certain users, or simply grant full ABM access. {#step-two-set-permissions-assign-specific-aspects-of-abm-to-certain-users-or-simply-grant-full-abm-access}

##### Step Three: *Configure your [Account Score](account-score.md)* - Account Scoring is one of the key elements in Account Based Marketing. It helps you determine the level of engagement of each account. {#step-three-configure-your-account-score-account-scoring-is-one-of-the-key-elements-in-account-based-marketing-it-helps-you-determine-the-level-of-engagement-of-each-account}

##### Step Four: * [Create a Custom Field for CRM Discovery](http://docs.marketo.com/x/1wnG) *- Map an existing CRM Account field to a new Named Account custom field (if you don't use a CRM, skip this step). {#step-four-create-a-custom-field-for-crm-discovery-map-an-existing-crm-account-field-to-a-new-named-account-custom-field-if-you-dont-use-a-crm-skip-this-step}

##### Step Five: *Create **Named Accounts* - Named Accounts hold the people from the companies you're targeting. There are four ways to create a named account: {#step-five-create-named-accounts-named-accounts-hold-the-people-from-the-companies-youre-targeting-there-are-four-ways-to-create-a-named-account}

* [Import Named Accounts](../../../product-docs/account-based-marketing/target/named-accounts/import-named-accounts.md) - Upload a list of potential target accounts directly into ABM (this can be a list that you exported from your CRM)
* [Discover CRM Accounts](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Discover+Accounts#DiscoverAccounts-DiscoverCRMAccounts) - View a list of all CRM accounts synced into Marketo and filter using key attributes (i.e. industry) to create named accounts
* [Discover Marketo Companies](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Discover+Accounts#DiscoverAccounts-DiscoverMarketoCompanies) - View a list of companies from sources other than your CRM and filter using key attributes to create named accounts
* [Create a named account manually](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Create+a+Named+Account) - If you create a named account manually, your next step is to [fill it with people](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Add+People+to+a+Named+Account) manually

##### Optional Step: * [Create and set-up Account Lists](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Account+Lists#AccountLists-CreateaNewAccountList)* - Group accounts into lists allowing you to target named accounts by industry, location, or size of the company. {#optional-step-create-and-set-up-account-lists-group-accounts-into-lists-allowing-you-to-target-named-accounts-by-industry-location-or-size-of-the-company}

After following the steps above, you are ready to start using ABM! Learn more about utilizing ABM-specific [filters and triggers](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Engage), and [measuring](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Measure) your ABM performance.
