**Step One: [Issue a License](/help/marketo/product-docs/account-based-marketing/setup-abm/issue-a-license.md)** - Decide who on your team is going to be using ABM.

**Step Two: Set [Permissions](/help/marketo/product-docs/account-based-marketing/setup-abm/permissions.md)** - Assign specific aspects of ABM to certain users, or simply grant full ABM access.

**Step Three: Configure your [Account Score](/help/marketo/product-docs/account-based-marketing/setup-abm/account-score.md)** - Account Scoring is one of the key elements in Account Based Marketing. It helps you determine the level of engagement of each account.

**Step Four: [Create a Custom Field for CRM Discovery](/help/marketo/product-docs/account-based-marketing/setup-abm/create-a-custom-field-for-crm-discovery.md)** - Map an existing CRM Account field to a new Named Account custom field (if you don't use a CRM, skip this step).

Step Five: *Create **Named Accounts* - Named Accounts hold the people from the companies you're targeting. There are four ways to create a named account:

* [Import Named Accounts](/help/marketo/product-docs/account-based-marketing/target/named-accounts/import-named-accounts.md) - Upload a list of potential target accounts directly into ABM (this can be a list that you exported from your CRM)
* [Discover CRM Accounts](/help/marketo/product-docs/account-based-marketing/target/named-accounts/discover-accounts.md#discover-crm-accounts) - View a list of all CRM accounts synced into Marketo and filter using key attributes (i.e. industry) to create named accounts
* [Discover Marketo Companies](/help/marketo/product-docs/account-based-marketing/target/named-accounts/discover-accounts.md#discover-marketo-companies) - View a list of companies from sources other than your CRM and filter using key attributes to create named accounts
* [Create a named account manually](/help/marketo/product-docs/account-based-marketing/target/named-accounts/create-a-named-account.md) - If you create a named account manually, your next step is to [fill it with people](/help/marketo/product-docs/account-based-marketing/target/named-accounts/add-people-to-a-named-account.md) manually

**Optional Step: [Create and set-up Account Lists](/help/marketo/product-docs/account-based-marketing/target/account-lists.md#create-a-new-account-list)** - Group accounts into lists allowing you to target named accounts by industry, location, or size of the company.

After following the steps above, you are ready to start using ABM!
