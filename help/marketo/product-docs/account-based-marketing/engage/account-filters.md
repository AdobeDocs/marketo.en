#### Member of Named Account {#member-of-named-account}

##### First, choose a qualifier. Is for a specific named account(s) or is any for any named account. {#first-choose-a-qualifier-is-for-a-specific-named-account-s-or-is-any-for-any-named-account}

##### If you use the "is any" qualifier, you may want to utilize [constraints](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Add+a+Constraint+to+a+Smart+List+Filter) to narrow your search results. Add as many as you'd like! {#if-you-use-the-is-any-qualifier-you-may-want-to-utilize-constraints-to-narrow-your-search-results-add-as-many-as-youd-like}
