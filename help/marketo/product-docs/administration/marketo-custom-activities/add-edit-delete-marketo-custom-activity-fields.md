   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The Api Name will not auto-populate when editing a field. While it's not required that the Field Name and Api Name match, we recommend they do.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >You can only edit the Api Name or change the field to Primary if the custom activity has never been published. If the activity has already been published, you can only edit the field's name and optional description.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you want to change which field is Primary, you must first deselect the existing one.

Your field is now edited!
