   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The [!UICONTROL Api Name] will not auto-populate when editing a field. While it's not required that the Field [!UICONTROL Name] and [!UICONTROL Api Name] match, we recommend they do.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >You can only edit the [!UICONTROL Api Name] or change the field to Primary if the custom activity has never been published. If the activity has already been published, you can only edit the field's name and optional description.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you want to change which field is Primary, you must first deselect the existing one.

Your field is now edited!
