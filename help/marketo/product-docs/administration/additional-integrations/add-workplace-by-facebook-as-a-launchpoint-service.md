# Add [!DNL Workplace By Facebook] as a [!DNL LaunchPoint] Service {#add-workplace-by-facebook-as-a-launchpoint-service}

There are two notification types included in the [!DNL Workplace] integration:

* **System notifications**: Get [!DNL Workplace] notifications regarding important events in your Marketo instance, like alerts about current campaign statuses and any issues that require immediate attention (CRM errors and API limits).
* **Interesting moments**: When a [!DNL Marketo Insight] has been triggered by a known individual from a sales account, lead owners can be notified via [!DNL Workplace]. Notifications include lead information as well as details about the sales account.
