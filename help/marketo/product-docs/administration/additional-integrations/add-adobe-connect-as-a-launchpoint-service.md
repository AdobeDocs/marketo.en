   >[!TIP]

   >When you create the participant password, the value you choose is included in a query string when the links are sent out for the event. So, we suggest that you make it customer-friendly.

   >Once you've logged into your Adobe Connect account, select the **Seminars** tab. Without drilling down into any specific seminar, copy the URL from your browser bar into the **Meeting Folder URL** setting.
