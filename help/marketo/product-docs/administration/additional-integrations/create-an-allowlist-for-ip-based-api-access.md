# Create an Allowlist for IP-Based API Access {#create-an-allowlist-for-ip-based-api-access}

Sometimes, you want to give API access only to a specific IP address or a range of addresses. To do this, you first enable restrictions, then specify the IP addresses that are allowed to use the APIs.

>This feature operates independently of Marketo Engage [IP-based login restrictions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/settings/restrict-marketo-logins-based-on-ip){target="_blank"} that are being replaced by Admin Console's [IP-based access control](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/ip-based-access.html){target="_blank"}. It will continue to function as-is after the Adobe IMS migration.
