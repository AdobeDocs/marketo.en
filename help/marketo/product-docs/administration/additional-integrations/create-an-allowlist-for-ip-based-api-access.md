# Create an Allowlist for IP-Based API Access {#create-an-allowlist-for-ip-based-api-access}

Sometimes, you want to give API access only to a specific IP address or a range of addresses. To do this, you first enable restrictions, then specify the IP addresses that are allowed to use the APIs.

>This feature operates independently of Marketo Engage IP-based login restrictions (being replaced by Admin Console's IP Access List*) and will continue to function after the [Adobe IMS migration](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/marketo-with-adobe-identity/adobe-identity-management-overview.md).

>&#42;The IP access list general availability is planned for Q4 2025.
