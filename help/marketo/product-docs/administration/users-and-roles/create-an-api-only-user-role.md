# Create an API Only User Role {#create-an-api-only-user-role}

If you want to integrate with Marketo via the [REST API](http://developers.marketo.com/documentation/rest/), the best practice is to [assign a user the API Only role](create-an-api-only-user.md) and then [create a custom service for use with ReST API](../../../product-docs/administration/additional-integrations/create-a-custom-service-for-use-with-rest-api.md). Here's how to create the API only user role.
