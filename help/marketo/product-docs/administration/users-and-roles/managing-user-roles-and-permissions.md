# Managing User Roles and Permissions {#managing-user-roles-and-permissions}

Set, create, and edit user roles and assign them to users. This allows you to control the areas and functionality that each Marketo user has access to.

For example, a marketing user typically needs broad access across the application, to create, modify, and deploy emails, landing pages, and programs. A web designer, on the other hand, spends almost all their time in the Design Studio, creating assets for use in emails and landing pages. And while company leaders make extensive use of Marketoâ€™s reports in the Analytics area, they may not need to create or drive the assets or programs themselves.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Admin Permissions Required**

Marketo provides several built-in roles, with different levels of access:

* **Admin** - all parts of the application, including the Admin section
* **Standard User** - all parts of the application, except the Admin section
* **Marketing User** - all parts of the application, except the Admin section
* **Web Designer** - only the Design Studio
* **Analytics User** - only the Analytics section

You cannot edit the Admin and Standard User roles, but you can edit the others. You can also create new custom roles to match the particular organizational structures in your company.

## Marketo with Adobe Identity {#marketo-with-adobe-identity}

If you're using Marketo with Adobe Identity, the list of profile descriptions [can be found here](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/marketo-with-adobe-identity/adobe-identity-management-overview.md#profile-levels).

## Assign Roles to a User {#assign-roles-to-a-user}

You can assign roles to a user when you [create users for the first time](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/create-delete-edit-and-change-a-user-role.md) or by [editing an existing user](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/managing-marketo-users.md).
