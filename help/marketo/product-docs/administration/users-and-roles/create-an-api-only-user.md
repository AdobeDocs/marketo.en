# Create an API Only User {#create-an-api-only-user}

If you want to integrate with Marketo via the [REST API](https://developers.marketo.com/documentation/rest/), you'll need to create an API only user. Here's how.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Add an optional [!UICONTROL Reason] or an [!UICONTROL Access Expiration] date. Access expiration dates are handy for short-term employees.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL API Only Role]** and check the **[!UICONTROL API Only]** checkbox. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

>[!NOTE]

>The pop-up says, "[!UICONTROL An invitation is not required for API only]," but that doesn't mean you've done something wrong. It just means we'll create the role without an invite email having to be sent.

Alrighty then! Now let's go ahead and create the custom service.
