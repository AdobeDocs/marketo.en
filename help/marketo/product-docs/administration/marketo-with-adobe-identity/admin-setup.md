# Admin Setup {#admin-setup}

Once you're added as a Marketo System Admin to an Adobe org, there are a few steps you'll need to take to complete the initial setup.

## System Admin Setup {#system-admin-setup}

1. After your Adobe org is established, the designated System Admin will receive a welcome email. In that email, click **Get Started**.

1. If you've previously accessed an application with an Adobe ID, you'll be taken straight to the Adobe Admin Console. If not, [set up your Adobe ID](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/create-update-adobe-id.html).

After the System Admin accesses the Admin Console, it's time to create a product profile.

1. Under Products and Services, click **Marketo Engage**.
