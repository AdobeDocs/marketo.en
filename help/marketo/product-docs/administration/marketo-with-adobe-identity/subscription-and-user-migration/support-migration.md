# Marketo Engage Support Migration {#marketo-engage-support-migration}

Learn more about the upcoming changes to your Adobe Marketo Engage Support experience. The changes are designed to enhance your user experience and streamline your administrative tasks.

## Marketo Engage Admin Console {#marketo-engage-admin-console}

The first update involves the introduction of the new [Adobe Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html){target="_blank"} for Marketo Engage users. The Adobe Admin Console gives you the ability to manage your users and subscriptions more efficiently. With this update, you'll have greater control of your administrative functions without any impact on how you currently use Adobe products. This means you can continue your day-to-day operations seamlessly while benefiting from the enhanced administrative abilities.

## Marketo Engage Support Portal Update & Migration {#marketo-engage-support-portal}

The second update will significantly improve the way you submit Support tickets. Previously, you used the [Marketing Nation](https://nation.marketo.com/){target="_blank"} portal to submit Support requests. Moving forward, this process will be streamlined by redirecting all Support ticket submissions to the Adobe Experience League. The Marketing Nation will remain home to the Marketo Engage/Measure community for the time being. In the near future, we will be moving those resources over to the Adobe Experience League as well.

## What's Changing? {#whats-changing}

* **System Admins will manage users and their access through the Adobe Admin Console** &mdash; Add and remove users as Support Admins/Product Support Admins for all your Adobe subscriptions.

* **Product Support Admins (PSAs) will use the Experience League for Support case creation and management** &mdash; Adobe will assign the Product Support Admin role for migrated users that are listed as an Authorized Contact in Marketing Nation.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Authorized Contacts are Product Support Admins in Adobe.

* **Case Migration** &mdash; Open cases will be visible in Adobe Experience League and all previously closed cases will be archived. This migration will **not** affect the service level of your open case(s).

## How will I know when the Support Migration has been completed? {#support-migration-has-been-completed}

The Support migration will occur after your User migration is completed for all subscriptions. If you've been added as a PSA as part of the Support Migration, you will receive an email after User migration is complete, indicating you have been added as a Support Admin to contact Support for those specific subscriptions. This will trigger an automatic redirect from the Marketing Nation to Adobe Experience League for all case submissions. Please continue to submit Support cases through the Marketing Nation until the automatic redirect is activated.

## Additional Resources {#additional-resources}

* Learn how you can use [the Adobe Admin Console to manage your Adobe entitlements](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-roles.html){target="_blank"} across your entire organization.  

* More information on how to log in to Marketo Engage with an Adobe ID [can be found here](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/marketo-with-adobe-identity/user-sign-in-with-adobe-id.md){target="_blank"}.
