>When the user is added to Marketo Engage via the Adobe Admin Console, they're granted the "Standard User" role within the Default workspace of the subscription. If the userâ€™s role within the workspace needs to be adjusted, that is done in Marketo Engage, [as described here](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/managing-user-roles-and-permissions.md).
