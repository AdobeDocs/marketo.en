# Adobe Identity Management Overview {#adobe-identity-management-overview}

All new Adobe Marketo Engage subscriptions (July 31, 2023 or later) come integrated with the Adobe Identity Management System. Existing Marketo Engage subscriptions are currently being migrated to the Adobe Identity Management System upon any sales event, which includes renewals, recontracting events, and/or addendums. Migrations outside of a sales event are supported as of October 2024. Marketo administrators will receive a notification 2-4 weeks in advance if their subscription is planned to be migrated outside of a sales event.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Marketo Support is not able to provide any updates regarding Adobe IMS migration. The Adobe Account Team will reach out with the estimated timeline in the coming months. For more information, please see [this article](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/marketo-with-adobe-identity/subscription-and-user-migration/understanding-marketo-subscription-and-user-migration-to-the-adobe-admin-console.md){target="_blank"}, and the [Frequently Asked Questions](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/marketo-with-adobe-identity/faq.md){target="_blank"}.

For subscriptions onboarded to Adobe identity, the Adobe Admin Console is used for user management. Identity-related concepts, like Single Sign On, are also managed in the Admin Console.

>If you want to implement Single Sign On and your subscription has been onboarded to Adobe Identity without SSO implemented in the Adobe Org, please submit a ticket to [Marketo Support](https://nation.marketo.com/){target="_blank"} and specify the topic as "Marketo on Admin Console, implementing SSO."
