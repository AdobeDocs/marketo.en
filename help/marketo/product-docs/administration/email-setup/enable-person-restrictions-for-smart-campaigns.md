# Enable Person Restrictions for Smart Campaigns {#enable-person-restrictions-for-smart-campaigns}

There is a feature in Marketo to limit the _maximum_ number of people that can qualify for a Smart Campaign. This avoids accidentally emailing your whole database.

>This applies only to batch campaigns and email programs.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Admin]** area.
