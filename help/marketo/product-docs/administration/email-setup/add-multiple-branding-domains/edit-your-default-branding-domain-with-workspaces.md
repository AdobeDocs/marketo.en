>When adding additional branding domains, you can choose to make this your primary domain for one or more workspaces, and all existing unsent emails set to “Default” and all newly created emails will default to the primary domain. You can override this on a per-email basis.

Now, you can [add additional branding domains](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/email-setup/add-multiple-branding-domains/add-an-additional-branding-domain-with-workspaces.md) you need for the workspaces.
