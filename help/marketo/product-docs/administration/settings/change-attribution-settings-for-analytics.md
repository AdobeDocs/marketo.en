# Change Attribution Settings for Analytics {#change-attribution-settings-for-analytics}

You can change the way Marketo ties contacts to opportunities for first- and multi-touch attribution, lead conversion metrics, and the marketing-influenced opportunity flag.

These settings will impact [!UICONTROL Revenue Explorer] reports under the [Program Opportunity Analysis](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics/program-analytics/understanding-the-program-opportunity-analysis-area.md), [Opportunity Analysis](/help/marketo/product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics/revenue-explorer/understanding-opportunity-analysis-in-revenue-explorer.md), and Lead Analysis areas. This will also affect the [!UICONTROL Program Analyzer] report.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Admin]** area.

   >[!TIP]
   >

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >**Definition**
   >
   >**[!UICONTROL Explicit]**: Only contacts with roles (default).
   >
   >**[!UICONTROL Hybrid]**: Contacts with roles if available. If none are available, it uses all contacts in accounts.
   >
   >**[!UICONTROL Implicit]**: All contacts regardless of role.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>When using **[!UICONTROL Implicit]**, Marketo will always examine all contacts associated to the account regardless of role. **Marketo strongly recommends using [!UICONTROL Explicit] mode**. Using [!UICONTROL Implicit] may create false positives; i.e., people with credit for an opportunity despite having no real influence in the opportunity. Use [!UICONTROL Implicit] with caution.
