# Restrict Marketo Logins Based on IP {#restrict-marketo-logins-based-on-ip}

You can restrict or enable users from accessing Marketo based on their IP addresses. Here's how.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Admin Permissions Required**

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe Admin Console (AAC) supports [IP-based access control](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/ip-based-access.html){target="_blank"}. To ensure a smooth transition, existing Marketo Engage IP restrictions will be active including Adobe ID users through Q1 2026 in subscriptions where this feature is enabled.
>
>* You can configure AAC IP-based access anytime.
>* Both AAC and Marketo Engage restrictions can run simultaneously. Use the same IP allow list for compatibility.
>
>After Q1 2026, Marketo Engage IP restrictions will be retired. IP-based access will be managed exclusively through AAC and must be configured to enforce login restrictions. A final transition date will be announced later.

   >**Definition**
   >
   >* **[!UICONTROL Allowed IP addresses]**: Adding allowed IP addresses is inclusionary. It will include all of the IP addresses specified and exclude everything else.
   >* **[!UICONTROL Block IP addresses]**: Prevents specific IPs from accessing Marketo.
   >* **[!UICONTROL Disable IP Restrictions]**: Checking this will stop any/all restriction rules from working. Use this for testing purposes.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can add multiple restrictions, but they can only be ALL allowed or ALL blocked. You cannot mix and match allowed and blocked.
