# Set Default Location Settings for a Subscription {#set-default-location-settings-for-a-subscription}

This article describes how an Admin would view and edit the default location settings for a subscription, including language, locale, and time zone.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Admin rights required. The language is not typically something that the Admin would change. It is specified at the time of purchase so that the subscription can be generated in the appropriate language.

## Set Default Location Settings for a Subscription {#set-default-location-settings-for-a-subscription-1}

When an Admin changes the default location settings, newly created users inherit these settings. Users can always [change their language, locale, and time zone preferences](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/settings/select-your-language-locale-and-time-zone.md) in their individual accounts.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Admin]** area.

   This subscription was created in English. Let's say you were in London and wanted to change the default locale and time zone. The locale determines the formatting for numbers, dates, and times.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Locale]** and change it to **[!UICONTROL English (United Kingdom)]**.
