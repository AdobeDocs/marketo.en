# Rename a Field {#rename-a-field}

>[!NOTE]

>You can rename a custom field in Marketo, but there's one catch: you must remove all of its use in the system before you do so. This includes forms, smart lists, and smart campaigns.

>[!NOTE]

>**Admin Permissions Required**

1. Go to Admin and click Field Management.
