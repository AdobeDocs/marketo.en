# Delete a Custom Field in Marketo {#delete-a-custom-field-in-marketo}

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Admin Permissions Required**

You may want to get rid of a field you created in the past if you no longer have a use for it. Unfortunately you can't delete fields in Marketo, but you _can_ hide them from the user interface.

1. In **[!UICONTROL Admin]**, go to **[!UICONTROL Field Management]** and select your field. In the **[!UICONTROL Field Actions]** drop-down, click **[!UICONTROL Hide Field]**.
