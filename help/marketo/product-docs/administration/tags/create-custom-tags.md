   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* Select "[!UICONTROL Required]" if you want this tag added any time a new program is created.
   >* Removing a program type from the ‘[!UICONTROL Applies to]’ list will delete the tag and its values from all existing programs of that type. If you want to preserve existing tag values and make this tag optional moving forward for _all_ program types listed, leave the "Required" checkbox unselected.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >If you want to make a similar tag required for some program types but optional for others, you'll need to set up two separate tags, each applying to different program types with one with "[!UICONTROL Required]" selected, and the other with "[!UICONTROL Required]" not selected.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]**.
