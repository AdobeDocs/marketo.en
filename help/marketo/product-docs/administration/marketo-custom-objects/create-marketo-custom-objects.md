# Create Marketo Custom Objects {#create-marketo-custom-objects}

Use custom objects in Marketo to track metrics specific to your business. This could be anything from cars, to courses--whatever you would like to model in Marketo to run your campaigns.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can set up custom objects to work on a one-to-many or many-to-many basis. You create the initial object the same way, but the steps are different when you start adding fields to the object. See  [Understanding Marketo Custom Objects](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/marketo-custom-objects/understanding-marketo-custom-objects.md) for more information.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot create, edit, or delete a Link or Dedupe Field once the custom object is approved.

## Create a Custom Object for a One-to-Many Structure {#create-a-custom-object-for-a-one-to-many-structure}

This example shows a Car custom object, for use in a one-to-many structure. Later, you'll create a course custom object and an intermediary object to use in a many-to-many structure.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Admin]** area.

   ![](assets/create-marketo-custom-objects-3.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The [!UICONTROL Marketo Custom Objects] tab displays all custom objects on the right, and details for any approved ones, including number of records and fields at the most recent update.

1. Enter a [!UICONTROL Display Name]. The [!UICONTROL API Name] and [!UICONTROL Plural Name] populate automatically. Enter a [!UICONTROL Description] (optional).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can edit these fields when you're creating them, but after they're saved, you can only edit the [!UICONTROL Plural Name] field and the **[!UICONTROL Show in Lead Detail]** slider.

1. Pull the **[!UICONTROL Show in Lead Detail]** slider over to display **[!UICONTROL Show]** if you want to view custom object data on the Database page. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   ![](assets/create-marketo-custom-objects-5.png)

1. The custom object information displays the content you entered. Notice that it's in a **[!UICONTROL Draft]** state.

   The next step is to add fields to [build out your custom object](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/marketo-custom-objects/add-marketo-custom-object-fields.md).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can only populate Marketo Custom Objects via a list import, or the [API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/rest-api).

## Create a Custom Object for a Many-to-Many Structure {#create-a-custom-object-for-a-many-to-many-structure}

This example shows a course custom object, which you'll use for creating a many-to-many relationship between people/companies and courses. When you're done, you'll create an intermediary object to connect it to people or companies in your database.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For a many-to-many relationship, you don't need to create a link in the custom object. Instead, you'll add two links to the intermediary object (see below).

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Admin]** area.

   ![](assets/create-marketo-custom-objects-7.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Marketo Custom Objects]**.

   ![](assets/create-marketo-custom-objects-8.png)

   >[!NOTE]

   >You can edit these fields when you're creating them, but after they're saved, you can only edit the [!UICONTROL Plural Name] field and the **[!UICONTROL Show in Lead Detail]** slider.

1. Pull the **[!UICONTROL Show in Lead Detail]** slider over to display **[!UICONTROL Show]** if you want to view custom object data on the Database page. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   ![](assets/create-marketo-custom-objects-11.png)

1. The custom object information displays the content you entered. Notice that it's in a **[!UICONTROL Draft]** state.

   >You can only populate Marketo Custom Objects via a list import, or the [API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/rest-api).

The next step is for you create your intermediary object (see below). But before that, you need to create a field to link to with it.

## Create an Intermediary Object {#create-an-intermediary-object}

Use an intermediary object to connect a custom object to people or companies. In this example, it's used to connect courses in your course custom object to people or companies in your database.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You don't need to create an intermediary object for a one-to-many custom object structure.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Admin]** area.

   ![](assets/create-marketo-custom-objects-13.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Marketo Custom Objects]**.

   ![](assets/create-marketo-custom-objects-14.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL New Custom Object]**.

   ![](assets/create-marketo-custom-objects-15.png)

1. Enter a [!UICONTROL Display Name]. The [!UICONTROL API Name] and [!UICONTROL Plural Name] populate automatically. Enter a [!UICONTROL Description] (optional).

   ![](assets/create-marketo-custom-objects-16.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can edit these fields when you're creating them, but after they're saved, you can only edit the [!UICONTROL Plural Name] field and the [!UICONTROL Show in Lead Detail] slider.

1. Pull the **[!UICONTROL Show in Lead Detail]** slider over to display **Show** if you want to view custom object data on the Database page. Click **Save**.

   ![](assets/create-marketo-custom-objects-17.png)

1. The custom object information displays the content you entered. Notice that it's in a **[!UICONTROL Draft]** state.

   The next step is for you to [add link fields](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/marketo-custom-objects/add-marketo-custom-object-link-fields.md) to connect your intermediary object to a person/company and a custom object.
