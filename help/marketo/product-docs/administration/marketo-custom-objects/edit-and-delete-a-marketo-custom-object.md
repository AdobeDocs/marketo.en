## Delete a Custom Object {#delete-a-custom-object}

It's easy to delete a custom object, but you need to be careful. Custom objects may be connected to other objects or to smart lists. So, Marketo warns you before letting you click **Delete**.

>[!CAUTION]

>You cannot restore a custom object after you delete it.

1. Go to the **Admin** area.

   >[!TIP]

   >You can also right-click the object and select **Delete Object**.

1. If the custom object is in draft form, not approved yet, you'll get this warning. If you're sure, click **Delete**.

1. If the custom object is already approved, there is greater risk if you delete it. So, you'll get this sterner warning. Enter **I understand**, check the **Cannot Undo** checkbox, and click **Delete**.
