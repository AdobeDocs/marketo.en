## Delete a Custom Object {#delete-a-custom-object}

It's easy to delete a custom object, but you need to be careful. Custom objects may be connected to other objects or to smart lists. So, Marketo warns you before letting you click **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>You cannot restore a custom object after you delete it.

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Admin]** area.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >You can also right-click the object and select **[!UICONTROL Delete Object]**.

1. If the custom object is in draft form, not approved yet, you'll get this warning. If you're sure, click **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

1. If the custom object is already approved, there is greater risk if you delete it. So, you'll get this sterner warning. Enter **[!UICONTROL I understand]**, check the **[!UICONTROL Cannot Undo]** checkbox, and click **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.
