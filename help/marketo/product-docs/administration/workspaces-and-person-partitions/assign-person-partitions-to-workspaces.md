These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

   Primary person partitions are the default where all peoples will be entered. Use [flow steps](../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/flow-actions/use-add-choice-in-a-flow-step.md) or [assignment rules](assigning-person-partitions-with-assignment-rules.md) to move people around.
