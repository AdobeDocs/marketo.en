   Primary person partitions are the default where all peoples will be entered. Use [flow steps](/help/marketo/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/flow-actions/use-add-choice-in-a-flow-step.md) or [assignment rules](/help/marketo/product-docs/administration/workspaces-and-person-partitions/assigning-person-partitions-with-assignment-rules.md) to move people around.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
