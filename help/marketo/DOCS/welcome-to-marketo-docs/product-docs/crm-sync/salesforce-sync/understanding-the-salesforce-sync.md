#### How Sync Works {#understandingthesalesforcesync-howsyncworks}

Marketo syncs with Salesforce all day, every day. Each sync takes some time and then pauses for 5 minutes, then starts again.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The very first sync in your subscription may take hours or even days because Marketo is copying the entire database from Salesforce. After that, each sync typically takes seconds or minutes and only syncs data that has changed.

The sync between Salesforce and Marketo is bidirectional only for leads, contacts, and Salesforce campaigns. In these cases, whenever you make changes in either Salesforce or Marketo, your updates will be reflected in both systems. All other syncs are from Salesforce to Marketo only.
