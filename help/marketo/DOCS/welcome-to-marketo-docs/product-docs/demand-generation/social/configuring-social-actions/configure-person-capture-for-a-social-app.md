Configure Person Capture for a Social App - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

When you create a [referral offer](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/demand-generation/social/referral-offers/create-a-referral-offer.md) or a [sweepstakes](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/demand-generation/social/sweepstakes/create-sweepstakes.md), you can configure what information you request and what information you require from people in order to participate.

These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

>People are only prompted for this information if they have not provided it previously.
