Understanding Free-form vs Guided Landing Pages - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

The template you choose determines what landing page editing mode you'll be working in. There are two possible paths: [free-form](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/demand-generation/landing-pages/free-form-landing-pages.md) and [guided](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/demand-generation/landing-pages/guided-landing-pages.md). Below you'll find a quick summary of the important differences.

#### Free-form Pages {#understandingfree-formvsguidedlandingpages-free-formpages}

* Drag and drop whatever content you want, wherever you want to place it.
* The template is like a SlideMaster in PowerPoint, just a background.
* Create a simple mobile version of your page with a click of a button.
* Best used when you don't have a lot of time or technical resources at your disposal.

#### Guided Pages {#understandingfree-formvsguidedlandingpages-guidedpages}

* Predefined layout/structure driven by the template.
* Only regions or variables defined as editable in the template can be customized in the editor. 
* Code changes required to modify layout and add additional assets.
* Look and feel across device determined by rules built into the template. 
* Best used if you've coded or purchased responsive templates or wish to modify a pre-built Marketo template.
