First create your Webinar in Level 3. If you need help, check out the [Level 3 Resource Library](http://www.level3.com/en/resource-library/). You'll find it to be very similar to BrightTalk.  Marketo uses a small subset of Level 3 fields:

* **Name** - The name of the webcast.
* **Start Date** - The start date for the webcast.
* **End Date** - The end date for the webcast.
* **Time Zone** - The time zone set for the webcast.
* **Description** - The webcast description.

1. Select your new event. Click **Event Actions,** then **Event Settings.**
