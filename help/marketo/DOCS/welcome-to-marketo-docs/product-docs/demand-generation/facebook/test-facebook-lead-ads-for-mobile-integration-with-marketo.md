   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >This is just an example, which uses a Learn More Call To Action. Your Lead Ad unit Call To Action might be different.

1. This is where the magic happens! Once you have submitted your form, [build a smart list in Marketo](../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/creating-a-smart-list/create-a-smart-list.md) as part of a program or in the lead database that uses the **Filled Out Facebook Lead Ads Form** filter. Insert the Lead Ad Form Name of the form you just submitted.
