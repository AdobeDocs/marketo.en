Text email links can be tracked in Marketo. Let's see how it works. 

##### 1. Select your email and click Edit Draft. {#addtrackedlinkstoatextemail-selectyouremailandclickeditdraft}

##### 2. Double-click the editable area you want to add the link to. {#addtrackedlinkstoatextemail-double-clicktheeditableareayouwanttoaddthelinkto}

##### 3. Enter the URL with double brackets, like this: [[www.domain.com/path/page.html]]. {#addtrackedlinkstoatextemail-entertheurlwithdoublebrackets-likethis-[[www-domain-com-path-page-html]]}

##### 4. Close out of the editor, and don't forget to approve the draft. {#addtrackedlinkstoatextemail-closeoutoftheeditor-anddon'tforgettoapprovethedraft}

>The mktNoTok class functionality does not work with trackable links in text emails. Only for HTML emails.

>Test it out to double-check. Make sure you entered the brackets correctly.

Nice work!
