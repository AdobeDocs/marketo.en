Test an Engagement Stream - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Once you've added all your content to a stream, you can test them out one piece at a time.

>[!NOTE]

>**FYI**

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).
