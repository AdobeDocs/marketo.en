Add People to an Engagement Program - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

There are several ways that people can become members of an engagement program:

* [Add to Engagement Program](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/add-to-engagement-program.md)
* [Change Engagement Program Cadence](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-engagement-program-cadence.md) flow step
* [Change Engagement Program Stream](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-engagement-program-stream.md) flow step
* [Change Program Status](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-program-status.md) flow step
* If a person fills out a form local to an engagement program
* Importing members into an engagement program (via Members tab within program)
* If you are using Salesforce as your CRM and have a Salesforce campaign tied to your engagement program, adding someone to the Salesforce campaign on the CRM side will also make them a member of the engagement program.
