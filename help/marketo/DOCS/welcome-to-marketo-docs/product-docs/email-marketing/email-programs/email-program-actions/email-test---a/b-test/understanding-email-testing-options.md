Understanding Email Testing Options - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Test your emails to improve their engagement score. There are two kinds of email testing in Marketo.

#### A/B Testing {#understandingemailtestingoptions-a-btesting}

This is for one-time emails using&nbsp; [email programs](../../../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/email-marketing/email-programs.md). Add&nbsp; [A/B testing](add-an-a-b-test.md)&nbsp;and a small group will get the test and the rest will get the winner.

#### Email Champion/Challenger {#understandingemailtestingoptions-emailchampion-challenger}

For ongoing emails used in trigger smart campaigns or&nbsp; [engagement programs](../../../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing.md),&nbsp;you can add&nbsp; [email champion/challenger](../../../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/email-marketing/general/functions-in-the-editor/email-tests-champion-challenger.md)&nbsp;testing. This will introduce variations to an ongoing percentage of the recipients.

Happy Testing!
