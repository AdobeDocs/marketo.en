Reference Yourself in a Dynamic Field - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Dynamic fields are our form of mail merge.

We allow you to personalize your email templates with predefined attributes like {{my_name}} or {{my_title}}. These fields allow you to quickly reference yourself in your email templates.

To add a self-referencing dynamic field to a template, just select the one you'd like to use from the **MSE Dynamic Fields** button in the template editor.
