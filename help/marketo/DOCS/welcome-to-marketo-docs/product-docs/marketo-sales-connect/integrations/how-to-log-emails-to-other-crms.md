How to Log Emails to Other CRMs - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

If your CRM provides you with a BCC address, you can use the "other" CRM section to set up email logging. Once the configuration is set up, emails that you send will automatically be logged to your CRM.

#### CRMs We Integrate With {#howtologemailstoothercrms-crmsweintegratewith}

**`Almost every CRM`**:

* Our `auto-BCC`* *feature works with nearly all CRMs record emails you've sent with Sales Connect to your leads. Just make sure your CRM of choice provides you with a BCC address to take advantage of this.

* We do all the above and more!
