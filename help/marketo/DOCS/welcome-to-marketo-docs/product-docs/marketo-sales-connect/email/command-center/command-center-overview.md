Command Center Overview - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

The Commend Center is a single, unified view that helps you figure out your next step, while making sure nothing falls through the cracks.

The Command Center allows you to: manage tasks, automate outreach campaigns, and identify the most engaged leads seamlessly in one view. Follow up instantly with an email or a phone call. This is mission control for salespeople.

The&nbsp;Command Center home page can be broken down into 3 parts:

1. [Tasks created](http://docs.marketo.com/x/dx-G) - a unified task list encompassing action items, CRM data, and engagement data.

2. [Scheduled emails](http://docs.marketo.com/x/7YPS) - helps manage and personalize your automated emails with the click of a button.

3. Sent emails - shows all emails you have sent in the last 30 days.
