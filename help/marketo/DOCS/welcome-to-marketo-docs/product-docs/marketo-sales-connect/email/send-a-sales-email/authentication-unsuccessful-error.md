Authentication Unsuccessful Error - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Do you see your emails in Failed Delivery with an "Authentication Unsuccessful" error? This means that we were unable to authenticate the connection to your SMTP server.&nbsp; Most likely, your password changed recently and you need to authenticate your new credentials.

1. Go to your [SMTP Settings](http://toutapp.com/next#settings/email-servers/smtp/configure) where you should see the same "Authentication Unsuccessful" error message.
1. Update your credentials and click **Authenticate and Save**.
1. Go to your Failed Deliveries and try resending those emails.

If you continue run into trouble, please [submit a case](http://nation.marketo.com/community/support_solutions) for Support.
