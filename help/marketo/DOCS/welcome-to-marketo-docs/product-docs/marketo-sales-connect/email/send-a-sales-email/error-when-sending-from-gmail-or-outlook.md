Error When Sending from Gmail or Outlook - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

When sending from Outlook or Gmail, the most common reason for receiving an error is not being on the most up to date version of Add-In/Extension.

**Check your Version**

In Outlook, go to ToutApp > Options > Check for Update.

In Gmail, open your Chrome extensions and update them there. If this doesn't resolve the error, try clearing your cache/cookies and sending again.
