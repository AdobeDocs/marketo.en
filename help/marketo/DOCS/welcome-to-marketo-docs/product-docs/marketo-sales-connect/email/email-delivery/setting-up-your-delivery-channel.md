Setting up Your Delivery Channel - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

When you start using Marketo Sales Connect, you'll need to set up an SMTP server in order to send out emails.

>[!NOTE]
>
>In addition to setting up your SMTP server, your [email identity has to be verified](http://docs.marketo.com/x/ewPh) before you can send emails.

You can choose to send emails using a Custom SMTP Server, a Team SMTP Server, or Gmail as a delivery channel. Let's go over each option.
