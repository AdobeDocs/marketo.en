Why Aren't Any of My Contacts Getting Pushed to Sales Connect? - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

If no contacts were pushed over, it's possible you have an invalid Salesforce connection. Go to your [Salesforce settings](http://toutapp.com/next#settings/crm/salesforce/configure) and disconnect then reconnect. Give it about 20 minutes to fully reset. If it's still zero after that, please [submit a case](http://nation.marketo.com/community/support_solutions) to Support.
