Didn't Log to Salesforce - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

If you aren't seeing your calls log to Salesforce, it might be because we cannot locate a Lead/Contact in Salesforce.  
  
For calls to log to the correct Lead/Contact, Sales Connect needs to have the Salesforce ID. The best way to add the Salesforce ID to Sales Connect is by using our [Push to Sales Connect](http://docs.marketo.com/x/XQDb) feature. When you use Push to Sales Connect we include the Salesforce ID in the contact migration.
