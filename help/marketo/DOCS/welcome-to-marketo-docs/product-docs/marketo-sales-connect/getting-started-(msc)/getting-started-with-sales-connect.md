####  Invite/Provision Users {#gettingstartedwithsalesconnect-ipuinvite-provisionusers}

If any users already exist on your account (previously from ToutApp), they'll show up in the **Team Access** tab of the Marketo section of Sales Connect.

You can provision your team as a Marketo Sales Connect User from this page. If you've never used ToutApp, or have yet to invite users, follow the steps in [this article](http://docs.marketo.com/display/TOUT/Invite+Team+Members).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Please wait ten minutes after connecting Sales Connect with Marketo before performing these steps.

1. Select one or more users, then click **Connect**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can only do the workspace assignment once at the time of inviting users. After it's set, you'll have to disconnect the user in order to change it.

   ![](assets/users.png)

1. If your Marketo subscription has workspaces enabled, you'll be able to assign workspaces to each user or set of users in bulk. If no workspaces are selected, weâ€™ll assign them to the Default Marketo workspace.

   ![](assets/nine.jpg)

1. Click the Workspace drop-down, select your desired workspace(s), and click **Connect**.

   ![](assets/ten.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you want to add new users, go to the Team Management section of Admin Settings and click the **Invite Users** button.

You can additional users from the Team Management page and follow the steps above to get them connected. 

#### Test Sales Connect in your Sandbox {#gettingstartedwithsalesconnect-sandboxtestsalesconnectinyoursandbox}

For teams who want to test Marketo Sales Connect with their Marketo Sandbox, an additional Sales Connect account can be provisioned upon request. This is only for customers who have purchased a Marketo Sandbox, or those who have it as part of their Marketo bundle. If you're interested in acquiring a Sandbox, please contact your Marketo Account Manager.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot provision a Sales Connect account with the same email ID to multiple instances. This means if you want to have an extra Sales Connect account to test with your Marketo Sandbox instance, you'll need to use a different email ID in each of the accounts.
