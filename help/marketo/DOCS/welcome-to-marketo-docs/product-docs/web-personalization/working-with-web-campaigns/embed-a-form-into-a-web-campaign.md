#### Three Ways to Add a Background Image to a Form {#embedaformintoawebcampaign-threewaystoaddabackgroundimagetoaform}

To add a background image to your form you can:

* Edit the CSS of a Form Theme
* Change the dialog or widget colors in Set Campaign
* Add CSS code to the script

To edit the CSS of a Form Theme, see [this article](../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/demand-generation/forms/form-design/edit-the-css-of-a-form-theme.md).

To change the dialog or widget colors in Set Campaign:

1. In the Rich Text Editor, select a Dialog campaign type and a dialog style, header color and background color to customize the form's background colors. Click **Save**.
