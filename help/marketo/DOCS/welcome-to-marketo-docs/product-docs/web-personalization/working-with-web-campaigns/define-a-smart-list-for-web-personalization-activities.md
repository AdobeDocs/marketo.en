Define a Smart List for Web Personalization Activities - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

You can use Web Personalization activities in filters and triggers when you're defining a smart list in a smart campaign. Here, you want to capture anyone who clicked a Web Personalization call to action (campaign).

Use a trigger to send an email or alert, or change a value or a score based on visitors who clicked and engaged with a Web Personalization call to action. You can also filter and view those leads that clicked on a Web Personalization call to action.

1. In your smart campaign, click the **Smart List** tab.

   >In a smart campaign with both triggers and filters, the triggers go at the top. When triggered, only people who satisfy the filter criteria will go through the flow.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >With multiple triggers, a person goes through to the flow if ANY one of the triggers gets activated.
