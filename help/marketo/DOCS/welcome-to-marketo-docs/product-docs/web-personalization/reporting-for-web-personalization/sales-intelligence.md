Marketo Web Personalization provides valuable information about the anonymous and known web visitors and organizations that visit your website.&nbsp;Sales executives can use it&nbsp;to track, monitor and receive alerts on key organizations and accounts according to specific region.

Access it by logging into the Marketo Web Personalization platform, through a daily/weekly email report, or by viewing it on the mobile app.

#### Define the User's Region {#salesintelligence-definetheuser'sregion}

To define the Organization and Visitor data you see in Marketo Web Personalization per your region, country or state, go to [User Settings](../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/web-personalization/getting-started-(rtp)/user-settings.md)&nbsp;and select the countries or states.&nbsp;
