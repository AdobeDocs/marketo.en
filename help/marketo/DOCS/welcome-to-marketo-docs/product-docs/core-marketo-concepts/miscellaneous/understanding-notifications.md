Understanding Notifications - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Notifications keep you up-to-date on system events happening in your Marketo subscription. For example, Campaign failure notifications inform you about errors in your smart campaigns, and CRM sync notifications alert you to critical issues found with the CRM sync, such as incorrect permissions or the sync being down.

#### Overview {#understandingnotifications-overview}

>[!NOTE]
>
>In some cases, a notification provides a "See the full list" link to download a comma-separated-value (CSV) file, for example, the Microsoft Dynamics Sync Errors file. Marketo retains these CSV files for 30 days. If you attempt to download the file after 30 days, you'll get a 404 error.

>[!TIP]
>
>Want to unsubscribe from notification emails? No problem. Simply click the **unsubscribe from Notifications** link at the bottom of the email.
