Event Check-in - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

The Marketo Events app for iPad or Android tablet&nbsp;makes it easy to check people in immediately when they arrive at your event.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

* [Set Up the iPad or Android Tablet](event-check-in/set-up-the-ipad-or-android-tablet.md)

This article outlines the complete process. The headings are linked to the separate articles, and some Marketo activities are links in this outline.&nbsp;

Some activities happen before the event, such as creating a new role and inviting attendees. Some happen during the event, such as checking in attendees.&nbsp;After the event, you sync your data with Marketo, updating the person's status.&nbsp;

Have a great event!
