Now that you know which people are in which revenue stages, you can market directly to them. Besides choosing **Revenue Stage** as a smart list filter, you can also choose it as an "if" filter in the flow.

1. In the desired flow step, click **Add Choice** and select **Revenue Stage** from the drop-down.
