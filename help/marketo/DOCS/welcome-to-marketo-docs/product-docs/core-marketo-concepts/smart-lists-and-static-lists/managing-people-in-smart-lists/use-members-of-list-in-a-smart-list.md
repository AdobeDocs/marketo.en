Use Members of List in a Smart List - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

>[!TIP]
>
>You can add people to a list using [Import](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/getting-started/quick-wins/import-a-list-of-people.md) or the [Add to List flow step](../../../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/flow-actions/add-to-list.md).

With this filter, you can pull members from another list by referring to it in your smart list rules. Here's how.

1. Select a smart list and click the **Smart List** tab.
