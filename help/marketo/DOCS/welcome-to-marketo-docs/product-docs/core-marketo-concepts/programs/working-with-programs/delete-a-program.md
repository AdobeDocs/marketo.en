Done. It's like the program never existed.

#### Why can't I delete my program? {#deleteaprogram-whycan'tideletemyprogram}

Programs can contain assets that are used elsewhere in the system - this will prevent you from deleting a program.

To fix the problem, you may need drill down and unapprove/delete. Follow these steps.

1. Click the link to go to the asset.

   Once you know where your asset is being used, go to it and unapprove/delete. Then try to delete your program again.
