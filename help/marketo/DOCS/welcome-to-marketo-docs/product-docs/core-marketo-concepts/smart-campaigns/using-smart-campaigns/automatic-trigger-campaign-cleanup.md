Automatic Trigger Campaign Cleanup - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Marketo has a nice/free service to deactivate triggered smart campaigns that no longer get activity. This speeds up overall system performance and saves you time.

>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

#### What happens? {#automatictriggercampaigncleanup-whathappens}

Once a quarter, Marketo will find smart campaigns that have sat dormant (no people) for 6 months or more and deactivate them.

#### Will you notify me first? {#automatictriggercampaigncleanup-willyounotifymefirst}

Of course! Once a quarter, you will receive a notification one week in advance showing every campaign we plan on deactivating.

1. Go to the **Notifications** tab.

#### Which campaigns will be deactivated? {#automatictriggercampaigncleanup-whichcampaignswillbedeactivated}

We will only deactivate trigger campaigns that have been active for over 6 months but have had 0 people qualify in that time period.

#### Wait! Not this campaign! {#automatictriggercampaigncleanup-wait-notthiscampaign}

Don't worry - the clock on any smart campaign can be reset by:

* A person qualifying for the campaign.
* Manually deactivating and reactivating the campaign.

Either will reset the 6-month counter.

#### Will you let me know which campaigns were deactivated? {#automatictriggercampaigncleanup-willyouletmeknowwhichcampaignsweredeactivated}

Absolutely - one week after the original notification, we will deactivate the listed campaigns (minus any that qualified at least one person or were deactivated/reactivated) and post a confirmation notification.

1. Select the **Idle Trigger Campaign Cleanup Scheduled **notification. Click the **These Idle Trigger Campaigns** link.
