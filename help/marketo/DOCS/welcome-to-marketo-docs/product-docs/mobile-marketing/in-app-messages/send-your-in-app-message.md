Send Your In-App Message - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

After you've [created your in-app message](create-an-in-app-message.md), it's time to send it out. Here are the steps:

* [Set Your In-App Message Audience](send-your-in-app-message/set-your-in-app-message-audience.md)
* [Select Your In-App Message](send-your-in-app-message/select-your-in-app-message.md)
* [Schedule Your In-App Message](send-your-in-app-message/schedule-your-in-app-message.md)
* [Approve Your In-App Message](send-your-in-app-message/approve-your-in-app-message.md)

>[!NOTE]

>When you're testing an in-app message triggered by **App Open**, be sure you download the app onto the phone, open it and close it. This initializes the SDK code. The *next* time you open the app, the in-app message will display. Custom events trigger the first time the app is opened.

Here's how to get started.

1. In Marketing Activities, click the folder where you want the program to live and choose New Program.
