>* **TLS 1.0 & 1.1 Deprecation**: In a continued effort to integrate with Adobe's release structure, we are shifting the deprecation of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 to January 13, 2020. More detailed information can be found [here](https://nation.marketo.com/docs/DOC-7059-tls-10-11-deprecation-faq).

>* **ITP 2.1+ Munchkin Update**: Due to changes to the cookie policy for Safari, Munchkin's ability to track users across sessions on the same domain will be limited by ITP to either 1 or 7 days based on the browser and browser version used by the visitor. To account for this, we are implementing a new web service to allow Munchkin cookies to be set with a Set-Cookie header via HTTP response. More information about how to implement this new service can be found [here](https://nation.marketo.com/docs/DOC-7351).
