#### Analytics {#releasenotes-fall'18-analytics}

**Bizible**

* **Reduce Required Dependency on CRM**

    * With the new option of defining Campaign rules within the Bizible settings, customers no longer need to jump through the hoops of installing a package or solution inside of their CRM to get started with Bizible. It’s now as easy as setting up an account, setting up the ad and CRM connections, then going through the standard settings and configurations. We expect that this will significantly improve onboarding times for our Sales Engineering team.

* **Discover GA**

    * Discover is out of beta and has started rolling out to new customers. We’re also migrating our current customer base from Bizible Measure to Bizible Discover. With the shift from beta to GA, we’ve made updates to the database schema to allow for more efficient and complex queries.

* **Single Sign-On**

    * Customers can now sign in to the Bizible web application using their company’s identity provider and credentials, which complies with enterprise security requirements.

** [Marketo Performance Insights Enhancements](../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/reporting/performance-insights/performance-insights-overview.md)**

* **Usability enhancements**
* `<li><p>Missing Acquisition Date Alert: To most accurately capture First- and Multi-Touch attribution insights, marketers are alerted when acquisition dates are missing from contact records so they can find and correct any issues.</p></li>` `<li><p>Trend Chart Time Range Improvements: Users can now go back 24 months to compare program performance.</p></li>` `<li><p>Scale-to-Fit Setting: The main dashboard bar chart is more easily readable to help compare program performance over time.</p></li>` `<li><p>Alerts Icon: The new alerts icon displays all active alerts regarding data quality issues and setup notifications.</p></li>` 

* **Engagement by Activity Date**: Users can select to view Engagement metrics by activity date or cost period.
* **ABM Named Account Filters**: Filter the Pipeline and Revenue dashboards by specific Named Accounts.

#### Ad Networks {#releasenotes-fall'18-adnetworks}

** [Refresh Token](../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/demand-generation/social/social-functions/set-up-linkedin-lead-gen-forms.md)**

We’ve implemented a refresh token within our retargeting and LinkedIn Lead Gen Form solutions that extends access time to one year before re-authentication is required.

#### API {#releasenotes-fall'18-api}

**Lead Map REST API**

Marketo now supports the use of email-disposition fields over the Lead APIs (includes Black Listed, Marketing Suspended, Email Suspended, and Relative Urgency).

>[!NOTE]
>
>As part of the Q3 release we will be upgrading the OAuth version for GoToWebinar from 1.0 to 2.0. This change is being made in advance of GoToWebinar deprecating the support for OAuth 1.0 in January 2019. If you are a GoToWebinar customer, you will need to re-authenticate through LaunchPoint (in the Admin area) before January 2019 to ensure that your integration will continue working.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Marketo is also upgrading libraries related to identity and authentication. While the upgrade is underway, you may notice intermittent errors if you have an active session open. If you experience issues, please log out and back in to your subscription.
