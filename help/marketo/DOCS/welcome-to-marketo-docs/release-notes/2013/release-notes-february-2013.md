#### Official Support for Apple Safari {#releasenotes-february2013-officialsupportforapplesafari}

The latest versions of Apple Safari for Mac and Windows are fully supported for use with Marketo Lead Management. Note: Safari on iOS is not fully compatible.

#### Webhooks Enhancements {#releasenotes-february2013-webhooksenhancements}

Webhooks is enhanced to escape tokens in the URL/payload and can also update Marketo lead fields by parsing XML/JSON responses from 3rd party systems (not available in the Spark SMB Edition).

#### Updated SOAP API Endpoint {#releasenotes-february2013-updatedsoapapiendpoint}

The preferred SOAP API endpoint has been updated, which is shown in Admin -> SOAP API. Please update your calls to use this new endpoint. API calls to the old endpoint are deprecated, but will continue to function. (SOAP API not available in the Spark SMB Edition)

#### Mobile Support for Facebook Tabs {#releasenotes-february2013-mobilesupportforfacebooktabs}

Facebook tabs published from Marketo will detect mobile devices and route them to a landing page. This will ensure that the user gets the right content on mobile devices on which Facebook tabs are not supported (available in Spark, Standard, Select SMB Editions and Marketo Social Marketing).

#### Coming Soon: Support for Multiple Models {#releasenotes-february2013-comingsoon-supportformultiplemodels}

We’re laying the groundwork to support multiple revenue cycle models, voted #1 idea for RCA in the Community, in a future release. In this release, you will notice some changes including [Smart List filters and Add Choices in Flow Steps](../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics/revenue-cycle-models/find-all-leads-in-a-revenue-cycle-model.md) to support the selection of a model and stage. We’re also moving the Lead Revenue Stage and Lead Revenue Cycle Model fields out of the Smart List Lead grid tab.
