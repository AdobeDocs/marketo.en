#### Date Operators {#releasenotes-july2014-dateoperators}

[Advanced filters](../../../welcome-to-marketo-docs/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-lists-and-static-lists/creating-a-smart-list/smart-list-filter-operators-glossary.md) for “in past before”, “in future”, and “in future after”. For example, find leads that have a birth date in the next 3 months, or a contract that is expiring after 6 months.
