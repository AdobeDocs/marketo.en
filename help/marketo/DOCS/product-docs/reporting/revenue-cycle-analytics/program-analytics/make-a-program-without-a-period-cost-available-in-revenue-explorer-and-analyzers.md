Make a Program Without a Period Cost Available in Revenue Explorer and Analyzers - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Program Period Costs allows you to define "How much money" and "When" for a program. This shows up in&nbsp; [revenue cycle explorer](../../../../product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics.md)&nbsp;and&nbsp; [analyzers](../../../../product-docs/reporting/revenue-cycle-analytics/opportunity-influence-analyzer/tell-the-marketing-story-with-an-opportunity-influence-analyzer.md). 

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Admin Permissions Required**

Some programs may need to be included even if they don't have a period cost. Although you can enter 0 for the period cost, we have made it easier to include these programs.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Program Analyzer buckets Program Success by period cost. If there is no period cost available, Program Success will not be displayed, regardless of the analytics behavior of the program. If the analytics behavior is set up, data will display for opportunity metrics (pipeline opportunities, revenue won, etc.).

>[!TIP]

>Did you notice the&nbsp;Operational&nbsp;option? This does the opposite. It excludes these programs regardless of period cost.

Nice job! Now any program using the modified channel will be included in revenue explorer and analyzers without the need for a period cost.
