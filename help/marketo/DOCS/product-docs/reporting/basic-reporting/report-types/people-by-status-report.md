People by Status Report - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Review how well you're moving people through the process by checking how many of them appear in each *Person Status* value every month.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

1. [Create a report](../../../../product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/creating-reports/create-a-report-in-a-program.md) and select the **People by Status** [report type](report-type-overview.md).
1. [Set the time frame of your report](../../../../product-docs/reporting/basic-reporting/editing-reports/change-a-report-time-frame.md) and click the **Report** tab.
1. Great! Now you can see how many people were in each Person Status, from month to month.
