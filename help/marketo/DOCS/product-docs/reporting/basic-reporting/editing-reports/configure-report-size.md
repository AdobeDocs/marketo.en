Configure Report Size - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

1. Go to the **Marketing Activities **area.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Changing the limit changes the report size itself, not just the exported Excel file, so if your report is taking too long to generate, reduce the limit!

1. Click **Save** to confirm the new limit.
