Remove from Flow - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Imagine you have a smart campaign flow that uses "Send Alert" to remind a sales rep to call a hot prospect. It sends one message every day until the rep makes the call. You could use "Remove from Flow" in a trigger campaign once the prospect has been contacted to stop further alerts. It's like a smart campaign ejector seat for a person.

>[!NOTE]

>This would normally affect people that are sitting in a campaign flow's wait step.
