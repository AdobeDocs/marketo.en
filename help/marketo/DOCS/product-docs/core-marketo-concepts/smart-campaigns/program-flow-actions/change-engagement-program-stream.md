Change Engagement Program Stream - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

#### Overview {#overview}

Normally you would use [stream transition rules](../../../../product-docs/email-marketing/drip-nurturing/engagement-program-streams/transition-people-between-engagement-streams.md) to achieve this, but if you want to manually move people from one stream to another, this is the flow step to use.

#### Usage {#usage}

1. Select the engagement program you want to move the person to.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you select a different program, it will leave the person in their current stream as well as add them to the new.
