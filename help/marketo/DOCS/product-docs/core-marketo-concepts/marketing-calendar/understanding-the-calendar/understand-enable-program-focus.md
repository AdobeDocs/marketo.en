Understand/Enable Program Focus - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

The Marketing Calendar gives you a bird's-eye view of things, but it also allows some interactions. You can&nbsp; [create](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/marketing-calendar/working-with-the-calendar/create-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar.md),&nbsp; [edit](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/marketing-calendar/working-with-the-calendar/edit-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar.md),&nbsp; [delete](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/marketing-calendar/working-with-the-calendar/delete-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar.md),&nbsp;and&nbsp; [confirm](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/marketing-calendar/working-with-the-calendar/confirm-entries-directly-in-the-marketing-calendar.md)&nbsp;entries. In order to interact with entries, you must focus on a program first.

1. Go to the **Marketing** **Calendar**.

   >Focusing on a program allows you to interact only with entries that belong to it and create new entries that will be housed by it.

1. Once you're done, release focus to interact with other programs/entries.
