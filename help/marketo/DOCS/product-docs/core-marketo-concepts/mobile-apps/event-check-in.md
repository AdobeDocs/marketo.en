Event Check-in - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

The Marketo Events app for iPad or Android tablet makes it easy to check people in immediately when they arrive at your event.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**FYI**
>
>Marketo is now standardizing language across all subscriptions, so you may see lead/leads in your subscription and person/people in docs.marketo.com. These terms mean the same thing; it does not affect article instructions. There are some other changes, too. [Learn more](http://docs.marketo.com/display/DOCS/Updates+to+Marketo+Terminology).

This article outlines the complete process. The headings are linked to the separate articles, and some Marketo activities are links in this outline.

Some activities happen before the event, such as creating a new role and inviting attendees. Some happen during the event, such as checking in attendees. After the event, you sync your data with Marketo, updating the person's status.

Have a great event!
