Schedule a Web Campaign - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

If you know when you want your web campaign to run, you can schedule it in advance. It's easy to set up start and stop dates, repeats, and multiple days.

You can schedule the web campaign based on the web visitor's time or a selected time zone.

>**Example**
>
>Scheduling start and stop dates is great for a scheduled event, such as a Webinar, that runs for a specific period. Repeats are perfect for a special offer that runs every week only on a particular day.

1. Go to **Web Campaigns**.
