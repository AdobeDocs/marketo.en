#### Before You Begin {#before-you-begin}

You should be familiar with the building blocks and the recommended sequence for creating Events in Marketo. You should also have working knowledge of the following Marketo concepts:

* [Marketo Programs](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/programs/creating-programs/understanding-programs.md) as well as Events, and the differences between them
* [Channels](../../../../product-docs/administration/tags/create-a-program-channel.md)
* [Local Assets](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/programs/creating-programs/understanding-local-assets-in-a-program.md)
* [Child Campaigns](https://docs.marketo.com/x/IRCa) and [Program Statuses](../../../../product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/smart-campaigns/program-flow-actions/change-program-status.md)

#### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The following are required to use the Marketo ON24 integration:

* **Subscription to ON24 webcasts** - If you do not have a current subscription, contact ON24 directly. **NOTE**: ON24 Hosted Edition is required. ON24 Event Management is not required.

* **Administrator rights to ON24** - You'll need this to use this connector and create guests in the ON24 system.

* **Registration form** - Use a Marketo form or a non-Marketo form along with the proper API to ensure registration data and registrant info is passed to Marketo.
