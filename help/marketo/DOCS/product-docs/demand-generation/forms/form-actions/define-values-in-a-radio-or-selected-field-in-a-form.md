Define Values in a Radio or Selected Field in a Form - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

Once you've [set a field type](../../../../product-docs/administration/field-management/change-the-type-of-a-marketo-custom-field.md) to be a radio button or select type, you'll want to define the values the user can pick from. Here's how.

1. Go to **Marketing** **Activities**.
