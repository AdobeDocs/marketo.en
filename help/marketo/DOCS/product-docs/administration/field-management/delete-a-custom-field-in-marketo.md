You may want to get rid of a field you created in the past if you no longer have a use for it. Unfortunately you can't delete fields in Marketo, but you *can* hide them from the user interface.

1. In **Admin**, go to **Field Management **and select your field. Under **Field Actions**, click **Hide Field**.
