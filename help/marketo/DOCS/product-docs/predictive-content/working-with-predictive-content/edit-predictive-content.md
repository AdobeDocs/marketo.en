>Depending on the purchase date, your Marketo subscription may include either Marketo Predictive Content or Content`<sup>AI</sup>`. For those using Predictive Content, Marketo is enabling Content`<sup>AI</sup>` Analytics features until April 30, 2018.

After you approve a title for predictive content, you can specify how you want to display it in your chosen source. The process is a little different for each source: email, Rich Media, and the Recommendation Bar.
