Why Didn't All of My Contacts Get Pushed to Sales Connect? - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

If only some of your contacts are pushing over, it's possible that the ones that didn't are marked as "email opt out" in your company's Salesforce instance.

Check the Alerts icon for detailed reasons why the whole group didn't push over. For reasons related to your company's Salesforce setup, please contact your SFDC administrator.
