Create a Follow-Up Email - Marketo Docs - Product Documentation

With Sales Connect's [Campaigns](http://docs.marketo.com/display/TEST/Campaigns) feature, creating a follow-up email is simple.

In the **Set Up** tab of your campaign, check the box to create an email as a follow-up, which will automatically thread your previous email into the next email in the campaign.
